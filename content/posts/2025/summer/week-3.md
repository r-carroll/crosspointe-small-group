## Read 
[Psalm 115](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/PSA.115.ESV)

## Questions
1. Where are you tempted go when you start feeling overwhelmed? 
2. What are some specific ‘gods of the world’ we might be tempted to trust in, and how can we practically encourage each other to turn to God instead?
3. When was a time in your life when you trusted God and he showed up?
4. God takes his glory very seriously. How do we practically ensure that when God works in our lives, our response is worship rather than self-exaltation? What does it look like to actively redirect glory back to God?
5. How does understanding God’s love as both sovereign AND steadfast change the way we approach Him during difficult seasons? How might this affect our prayers or expectations?

## Prayer Focus
This week, pray specifically for God to reveal areas where you’re tempted to trust in “powerless gods” - whether that’s your own ability to control outcomes, your financial security, other people’s opinions, or technology for peace. Ask Him to help you recognize when anxiety or overwhelm first starts to rise, and to make your first instinct turning to Him rather than these other sources of help.

## Next Steps
The “First Turn” Challenge
Throughout this week, practice making God your “first turn” rather than your last resort. Here’s how:
1.	Identify your “phone moments” - Notice when you instinctively reach for your phone, social media, or other distractions when feeling stressed or anxious.
2.	Pause and pray first - Before reaching for that comfort or distraction, take 30 seconds to acknowledge God’s sovereignty over your situation and ask for His help.
3.	End-of-day reflection - Each evening, briefly consider: “What did I turn to for help today? When did I remember to turn to God first, and when did I forget?”
