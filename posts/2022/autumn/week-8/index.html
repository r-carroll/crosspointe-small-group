Let no one disregard you.\nDiscussion Questions What was the most impactful thing from the text and the sermon this week? We typically struggle with the idea that we are transformed by God’s grace. Why do you believe we struggle and how can we preach the gospel to ourselves to help overcome the pull of our flesh? Discuss the two extremes we are typically pulled to when it comes to God’s grace. How should God’s grace affect our lives according to verse 12? Read vs. 13. Discuss how the appearing of Christ should impact your life today. How is this different from the way many view or teach on prophecy? Read vs. 15. Paul told Titus to not let people disregard him. What did Paul mean? Please provide examples to show how believers disregard elders. Next Steps We are finished with another year of small groups at CrossPointe take some time to reflect on how your small group has encouraged and challenged you to grow in Christ. Write down the things you are grateful for and the things you want to contribute next year.\nPrayer Focus Pray for your small group members over the upcoming holidays. Specifically, pray that God will comfort them, protect them, and use them to share the good news of salvation with friends and family.\n","wordCount":"351","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-11-20T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-11-20T00:00:00Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://smallgroup.carrollmedia.dev/posts/2022/autumn/week-8/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Small Group Notes","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://smallgroup.carrollmedia.dev/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://smallgroup.carrollmedia.dev/ accesskey=h title="Small Group Notes (Alt + H)">Small Group Notes</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><h1 class=post-title>The Grace of God</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2022-11-20 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>November 20, 2022</span></div></header><div class=post-content><h2 id=announcements>Announcements<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#announcements>#</a></h2><ul><li>Church office is closed Wednesday and Thursday</li><li>No Mid-Week Activities on Campus this week</li><li>Children’s Christmas Program is December 4th</li><li>Church vote on 2023 spending plan is December 4th</li></ul><h2 id=big-idea>Big Idea<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#big-idea>#</a></h2><p>The grace of God is required for life and godliness.</p><h2 id=read-titus-211-15>Read: Titus 2:11-15<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#read-titus-211-15>#</a></h2><p>For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation for all people, 12training us to renounce ungodliness and worldly passions, and to live self-controlled, upright, and godly lives in the present age, 13waiting for our blessed hope, the appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ, 14who gave himself for us to redeem us from all lawlessness and to purify for himself a people for his own possession who are zealous for good works.
