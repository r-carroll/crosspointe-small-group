## Next Steps
Romans is one of the most important books in the Bible, and it is essential reading for every believer. This week, take inventory of your life and how willing you are to be used for God’s purpose and plan.

## Prayer Focus
We want to be a church that shares the gospel of God with the lost. Pray for God to give you the boldness to witness to lost people and for God to bring lost people to CrossPointe so they can hear the good news and trust Christ.
