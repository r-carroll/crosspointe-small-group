Others have big plans for the future. To hear them talk about it, they are always one lucky break from striking it rich or landing their dream job. They boast about a “done deal” before the deal is actually done. This is all very foolish, because if there is one thing we can never presume, it is to know the future.\n– Philip Graham Ryken, Ecclesiastes: Why Everything Matters, Preaching the Word (Wheaton, IL: Crossway Books, 2010), 245–246.\nMake your voice heard One of the admonishments from this Sunday was to confront our leaders when they are foolish and urge them to follow God.
