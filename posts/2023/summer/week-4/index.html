How can we discern whether someone is operating in the flesh or guided by the Holy Spirit?\nRead Jude 20-21. What instructions are given to believers in order to counteract the influence of the scoffers and stay firm in their faith? How can we practically apply these instructions in our lives today?\nReflect on the phrase “keep yourselves in the love of God” from verse 21. How does this concept align with God’s unconditional love for us?
