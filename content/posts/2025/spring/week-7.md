## Icebreaker Question
What’s a time when you were asked to do something outside your comfort
zone? How did you respond, and what did you learn from it?
## Questions
1. How does God's presence in Gideon's fear-filled context shape your
understanding of how God calls and equips His people?
2. Why do you think Gideon questioned God’s past faithfulness (v.13), and how
does God’s response in verses 14–16 shape how we should respond in seasons
of doubt or discouragement?
3. What does the Lord’s promise in verse 23 reveal about the connection
between divine assurance and our capacity to serve? How have God’s
promises strengthened you personally in a time of fear or uncertainty?
4. Why is it significant that Gideon's first response after this encounter is to
build an altar and name it “The LORD is Peace” (v.24)? What does that reveal
about worship as a response to God's provision?

## Next Steps
Write out a biblical promise related to
peace, presence, or courage. Keep it
visible (mirror, dashboard, phone lock screen) to remind you of God’s
provision. 

## Prayer Focus
Ask the Lord to strengthen you for the
work He’s calling you to and to anchor
you in His peace as you step forward.
