## Big Idea
Incomplete knowledge is not always a reason for inaction.

## Read: Ecclesiastes 11:1-6
Cast your bread upon the waters,
for you will find it after many days.
2 Give a portion to seven, or even to eight,
for you know not what disaster may happen on earth.
3If the clouds are full of rain,
they empty themselves on the earth,
and if a tree falls to the south or to the north,
in the place where the tree falls, there it will lie.
4He who observes the wind will not sow,
and he who regards the clouds will not reap.
5As you do not know the way the spirit comes to the bones in the womb of a woman with child, so you do not know the work of God who makes everything.
6In the morning sow your seed, and at evening withhold not your hand, for you do not know which will prosper, this or that, or whether both alike will be good.

## Discussion Questions
1. What was the most impactful thing from the text and the sermon this week?
2. Last week you were asked to consider what it means for you to live boldly by faith.
What is your response and why do you believe it can be so difficult?
3. Read verse 2. How does Solomon’s instruction help fight against a self-focused or
hoarding lifestyle?
4. Read verse 4. What was Solomon’s point in this verse and what does a
balanced approach between being wise and being foolish look like?

## Next Steps
This week consider how much you give to others and to the Lord through CrossPointe
Church. Does your giving indicate that you are living boldly by faith? If not, are you
willing to change?

## Prayer Focus
October is Mission Emphasis month at CrossPointe. Spend time this week praying for
missionaries Michael and Shaleena Quinlan who are preparing to go to Athens,
Greece. Pray also that the people of CrossPointe will demonstrate radical generosity in
giving to missions over the next year.
