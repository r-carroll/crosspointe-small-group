God’s Purposes Never Fail.
## Read
[Romans 11:7-12](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/ROM.11.ESV)

## Icebreaker Question
What’s the biggest “plot twist” you’ve ever experienced — in a movie, a book,
or even in real life?

## Questions
1. What insight, principle, or observation from this week’s sermon was the
most helpful, eye-opening, or troubling? Explain.
2. In verses 7–8, Paul says Israel did not obtain what it was seeking, but “the
elect obtained it, and the rest were hardened.” 
What does this teach us
about God’s sovereignty and human responsibility?

3. Verses 9–10 quote David: “Let their table become a snare and a trap.” How
can blessings or privileges become stumbling blocks when misused?

4. In verse 11 Paul asks,
“Did they stumble in order that they might fall? By no
means!” How does this verse guard us from despair when we see failure and
defiance against God?

5. In verse 12 Paul says,
“If their trespass means riches for the world… how much
more will their fullness mean!” What is this “fullness”, and how does it give
us hope today?

## Next Steps & Prayer Focus
Identify one area in your life right now where
God’s purposes seem unclear and write it
down on a card or in your journal. Each day
this week, pray over that situation and remind
yourself that God’s purposes will not fail. At
the end of the week reflect on how this
practice has shaped your trust in God.
