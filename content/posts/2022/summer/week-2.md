## Big Idea
The local Church is by God’s design, the place for us to grow in the Word of God, as we commit to Him and each other, with hearts that please Him in all that we do.

### Scripture reading
Acts 2:36-47

Let all the house of Israel therefore know for certain that God has made him both Lord and Christ, this Jesus whom you crucified.” 37 Now when they heard this they were cut to the heart, and said to Peter and the rest of the apostles, “Brothers, what shall we do?” 38 And Peter said to them, “Repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. 39 For the promise is for you and for your children and for all who are far off, everyone whom the Lord our God calls to himself.” 40 And with many other words he bore witness and continued to exhort them, saying, “Save yourselves from this crooked generation.” 41 So those who received his word were baptized, and there were added that day about three thousand souls. 42 And they devoted themselves to the apostles’ teaching and the fellowship, to the breaking of bread and the prayers. 43 And awe came upon every soul, and many wonders and signs were being done through the apostles. 44 And all who believed were together and had all things in common. 45 And they were selling their possessions and belongings and distributing the proceeds to all, as any had need. 46 And day by day, attending the temple together and breaking bread in their homes, they received their food with glad and generous hearts, 47 praising God and having favor with all the people. And the Lord added to their number day by day those who were being saved.

### Discussion Questions
1. Read Lev. 23:4-22. Why is it important to understand these feasts as they relate to Christ and his plan of redemption?
2. The very first thing that happened after the baptism of the Holy Spirit was preaching. Peter stood up and gave a doctrinally sound sermon. The book of Acts is full of individuals preaching the gospel. Tell the group a time when God used a sermon to change your life.
3. Are you as committed to the church as you should be? Meaning are you as committed to the Pastors and Deacons, and other members. Not just yes or no, but talk about what you can do and how the group and hold you accountable.
4. Are you, as a believer, a consumer or a giver? A person who wants Church to be catered to your wants, or to God’s plan? Everyone needs work in these areas, how can we better serve one another with love and edification?
5. The seven churches in the book of Revelations were all in close proximity to one another, yet different praise and warnings were given to each church. What do you think it meant to have your lampstand removed as written in Revelation 2:1-5?
6. How important is submission to leadership as laid out for us in Heb. 13:17; 1 Peter 5:1-5; Titus 2:7-8? And what does the Bible say about not submitting to Pastoral authority?

### Prayer Focus
This week pray for one another that you would be committed to one another in love, caring for each other’s spiritual needs. Commit to praying for the leadership that they would be submissive to Christ and his purposes for Crosspointe.

### Next Steps
Read Revelation 2 and 3, as well as the introduction to every epistle written to a Church. Pray that God would show you the bond of fellowship these churches had and realize sin and unbelief destroy this fellowship. Epistles written to churches:
* Romans
* 1 and 2 Corinthians
* Galatians 
* Ephesians
* 1 and 2 Thessalonians
* Philippians
