## Big Idea
Jesus restores what Adam destroyed.

## Read: 
[Romans 5:15-21](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/ROM.5.ESV)

## Discussion Questions
1. What insight, principle, or observation from this week’s sermon was the most helpful, eye-
opening, or troubling? Explain.
2. What is the main contrast between Adam's trespass and Christ's gift in Romans 5:15?
3. What does Paul mean when he says that “grace reigns through righteousness” in Romans
5:21?
4. How does understanding Adam as a "type" of Christ help us grasp the significance of
Christ’s work (Romans 5:14, 18-19)?

## Next Steps
Let grace, not guilt or fear, reign in your life. Consider how you can allow God’s grace to shape
your attitudes, decisions, and relationships. When faced with temptation or difficulty, remind
yourself that you are no longer under the reign of sin and death, but under the reign of grace.
Actively seek to reflect Christ’s righteousness in your daily life, extending grace to others as you
have received it from God.

## Prayer Focus
This is Mission Emphasis Month at CrossPointe. This week, focus on the mission at home. We
often give generously to support global missions, but we must also give to fund the local ministry
initiatives at CrossPointe. Pray that God will make you generous to your church
