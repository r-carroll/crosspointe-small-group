## Scripture:
[ Ephesians 4:17-24](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/EPH.4.ESV)

## Small Group Discussion
1. This week concluded this mini-series, which was an extension of the original “Serve the
Lord” series from January of this year. What will you stick with you from these messages on
Christian service?
2. What does Paul mean when he says that the Gentiles walk in the “futility of their minds” (vs.
17)? Why are their minds this way?
3. In verse 19, Paul notes that the Gentiles “have become callous,” giving themselves up to sin.
What can we do to seek not to be similarly callous?
4. In verse 23, Paul directs Christians to “be renewed in the spirit of your minds.” Read also
Rom 12:1-2. What does it mean to be “renewed” this way? How do we pursue it?
