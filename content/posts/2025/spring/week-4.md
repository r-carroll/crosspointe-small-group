## Read
[Romans 8:31-34](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/ROM.8.ESV)

## Icebreaker
What’s something small that gives you a sense of security- like a favorite spot,
item, or phrase? Why do you think that brings comfort?

## Quesions
1. What does Paul mean when he asks,
“If God is for us, who can be against
us?” How does this truth change the way we see hardship or opposition?
2. How does Paul’s argument in verse 32 deepen our assurance? What does the
cross teach us about God’s commitment to us?
3. What does it mean that Jesus is “at the right hand of God…interceding for
us”? How does this image provide comfort when we feel guilt or spiritual
failure?
4. Why is it difficult to rest in the assurance that God is for us, and what habits
help you return to that truth?

## Prayer Focus
Ask the Spirit to reveal any voices of
accusation or condemnation you’ve accepted
as truth—whether from shame, fear, the enemy,
or yourself. Confess them openly and
specifically. Then pray Romans 8:33–34 to remind you of your security in Christ.

## Next steps
Build a playlist of worship songs that declare
Christ’s love, advocacy, and intercession. Use
it during your commute, morning routine, or
prayer time to center your heart on the truth
that Jesus is for you, not against you.
