## Big Idea
God doesn’t need you, but He desires to use you for His purpose.

## Read: Esther 4:1-17
[Bible app link](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/EST.4.ESV)

## Discussion Questions
1. Describe a time the Lord directed you to do something, but you were full of fear rather
than faith and did not obey. Why is Esther 4 a good chapter for many of us who have
been in this position?
2. How does the gospel fuel obedience to God in the life of a believer?
3. Mordecai didn’t hide his grief but displayed it publicly for all to see. Why do we tend to
conceal our grief or struggles rather than sharing them openly? What does the Bible say
about being honest with each other in our struggles?
4. We are often hopeful that somebody in the church will step up to meet a need or create
an outreach ministry, why do you believe we continually hope someone else will do what
we see needs to be done?
5. Verses 15-17 uncover a substantial reversal from earlier in Esther’s story. Identify and
discuss what this reversal means for Esther’s development and how it applies to you
personally.

## Next Steps
God desires to use you, not because you are perfect, not because you are highly gifted, not
because you are intelligent, wealthy, well-educated, or skillful. God desires to use you because
He is full of grace and mercy—it is an honor to be used by the King of Kings. This week read and
meditate on 1 Corinthians 1:26-31, then journal your thoughts about how this passage applies
to you.

## Prayer Focus
Christ is a far better mediator than Esther. Our Great High Priest (Heb.7:22-28) brings us into
the presence of God who has promised to always receive us in prayer. We are called to follow
the example of Christ, so focus your prayers on interceding for members of your small group.
