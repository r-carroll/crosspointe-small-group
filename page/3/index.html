Questions What stood out to you in this week’s message? What was good, helpful, convicting, troubling, or led to more questions for you? Why is the Word of God so important? Why do you think it can be so difficult for believers to be unified? What is the attitude Paul says the church is to have towards one another? Paul says we are to speak the truth in love. How is this often handled incorrectly and share an example (real or fictional) or how this should look in the church. Next Steps: How much time do you spend in the Word? If you think you should be spending more time studying the Word make a plan this week to follow through on it and possibly use your group to help keep you on track.

Read: Romans 2:1-4
Discussion Questions How does Romans 2:1-4 address the issue of self-righteous judgment? What role does God’s kindness play in His judgment according to Romans 2:4? How does Paul address moralists in Romans 2:1-3, and what broader message does he convey about sin and judgment through this approach? What warning does the sermon give about presuming upon God’s mercy, and what should be our correct response to God’s patience and kindness? Next Steps Consider how the awareness of your own guilt before God and the understanding of His mercy can transform your daily interactions and your overall perspective on life. Let this passage challenge you to live authentically, humbly acknowledging your need for grace and extending that grace to others.

Read: Romans 1:19-32
Discussion Questions Romans 1:24-25 explains that God turns people over to their selfish desires due to their rejection of Him. How do these selfish desires manifest in today’s society, and what are some examples of how they lead to personal and societal destruction? In Romans 1:26-27, Paul describes God turning people over to unnatural activities due to their opposition to Him. What are some contemporary examples of such activities, and how do they contribute to the moral decay and destruction in individuals’ lives and society as a whole? Romans 1:28-32 details how God turns people over to depraved thinking due to their persistent rejection of Him. How does this depraved thinking manifest in behavior, and what are the consequences for both individuals and communities? Considering the progression described in Romans 1:24-32—from selfish desires to unnatural activities to depraved thinking—how can recognizing these stages help us understand the destructive path of opposing God? Next Steps It’s easy for us to begin to think that we are what’s right with society and, as a result, begin to despise those whose behavior is described in this passage. Yet, we must remain humble if we are to be compassionate and effective in sharing the gospel. This week, read and meditate on the message of 1 Corinthians 6:9-11.

Read: Romans 1:18
Discussion Questions Reflecting on the concept of God’s holiness, why do you think it’s challenging for humans to fully grasp the idea that God is both transcendent and morally pure? How does this understanding impact our view of sin and our relationship with God? Ungodliness leads to unrighteousness. How do you see this progression playing out in your own life or in the world around you? What are some practical ways to guard against this downward spiral? The sermon emphasizes that God’s wrath is rightly directed toward those who actively oppose Him and suppress the truth. How does this understanding of God’s wrath impact our perception of His mercy and patience? How can we reconcile God’s wrath and His love? Next Steps Do you only talk about God’s love when trying to evangelize others? If so, think about how to effectively communicate God’s wrath and love to others this week.

Read: Romans 1:18
Discussion Questions In what ways do we see God’s wrath being revealed in the world today, and how does this align with the depiction of God’s wrath in Romans 1:18? Romans 1:18 states that God’s wrath comes from heaven against all godlessness and wickedness of people who suppress the truth. How can we understand and explain the justification of God’s wrath in a contemporary context where the idea of divine wrath might be challenging or misunderstood? How does Paul establish that God’s wrath is not arbitrary but is directed specifically at human actions that involve suppressing the truth? Discuss examples of how truth is suppressed in society today and relate this to the concept of divine retribution. Considering the nature of God’s wrath as revealed, justified, and rightly directed, how should this influence the behavior and beliefs of Christians today? How can believers reconcile the concept of a loving God with the reality of God’s wrath? Next Steps How often do you think of God as a wrathful God? This week, consider the implications of God’s wrath and thank Him that He has forgiven you and adopted you into His family.

Read Romans 1:16-17
Discussion Questions How does Paul describe the power of the gospel in Romans 1:16, and what implications does this have for how we view and share the gospel with others? Paul emphasizes that the gospel is for “everyone who believes” (Romans 1:16). How does this universal call to belief challenge or reinforce our understanding of who needs salvation and who can receive it? Romans 1:17 states, “In it the righteousness of God is revealed from faith to faith.” How does understanding this righteousness as the righteousness God imputes to believers change our view of personal moral achievement and the basis of our salvation? Considering that the gospel reveals both God’s power to save and man’s need for salvation, how should this dual revelation shape our understanding of evangelism and discipleship in relation to human responsibility and God’s sovereignty? Next Steps Is there someone you know who needs to hear the gospel? Will you commit to going to them as soon as possible to share the good news that they can be made right with God?

Read Romans 1:8-15
Discussion Questions What stood out to you? In verse 8, Paul expresses gratitude for the faith of the Roman Christians. How does expressing gratitude for the faith of others contribute to building a strong Christian community? In verse 10, Paul mentions his desire to visit the Roman Christians. What do you think motivated Paul’s desire to do so? How does face-to-face interaction impact our relationships with fellow believers and our ability to support and encourage one another? Verse 11 speaks of Paul’s longing to impart some spiritual gift to the Romans to strengthen them. What do you think Paul means by “spiritual gift” in this context? How do spiritual gifts contribute to the growth and edification of the church today? Paul expresses his eagerness to preach the gospel in Rome in verse 15. What do you think made Paul so eager to preach the gospel, even to those who were already believers? How can we cultivate a similar eagerness to share the gospel with others? In verses 13-14, Paul states that he has often intended to visit Rome but has been prevented. Have you ever experienced obstacles or hindrances in serving God or fulfilling His purposes? How did you respond to these challenges, and what did you learn from them? Next Steps We care about many different things, and it’s very easy to become drawn away by the things that matter to us. As you spend time with the Lord this week, think about how your life reflects genuine care for others as it relates to the gospel.

Read: Romans 1:1-7
Discussion Questions What insight, principle, or observation from this week’s sermon was helpful, eye-opening, or troubling? Explain. In verses 3-4, Paul describes God’s Son in two ways. How do those two ways relate to the Old Testament, and why is this important? The purpose of bringing about “the obedience of faith” is for “the sake of His name among all nations” (1:5). How do you fit into this grand plan? Name how this opening passage in Romans gives you confidence as a believer. Please explain your answer. Next Steps How much time do you spend reading and studying the Old Testament? As you consider Paul’s greeting to the believers in Rome, consider its value and the impact that section of God’s Word has made on your life.

Read: Romans 1:1
Discussion Questions What insight, principle, or observation from this week’s sermon was helpful, eye-opening, or troubling? Explain. Paul called himself a slave, an apostle, and one who was set apart for the gospel of God. Which of these descriptions resonates most with you? Explain your answer. Why don’t genuine apostles still exist? Read 1:1-7 and 16:25-27. What similarities exist in those two passages? What themes do these verses reveal? Name one or two things you hope to learn from our study in Romans. Next Steps Romans is one of the most important books in the Bible, and it is essential reading for every believer. This week, take inventory of your life and how willing you are to be used for God’s purpose and plan.

Text: Judges 2:1-15
Discussion Questions What stood out to you, made you think, or was something that you liked, or remember from the sermon? Or What are you excited about, if anything, in studying the book of Judges? How did the Israelites disregard God? With consideration to question 2, how does it look for “modern day” Christians to disregard God in the same way? Pastor Matt quoted his mother, “If you play with the pigs you’ll eventually end up smelling like them” what did she mean and how does or can that relate to us today and to this passage? What were the three challenges that were given at the close of the message and how can we practically apply them to our lives today? Next Steps: Examine question number 5 and search your life this week and ask the Holy Spirit to point out in your personal life where you need to apply this week’s message. Where are you disregarding God in your life and how can and will you change it?
