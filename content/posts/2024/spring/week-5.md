## Big Idea
God’s wrath cannot be ignored.

## Read: 
[Romans 1:18]((https://www.bible.com/bible/59/ROM.1.ESV))

## Discussion Questions
1. In what ways do we see God's wrath being revealed in the world today, and how does
this align with the depiction of God’s wrath in Romans 1:18?
2. Romans 1:18 states that God’s wrath comes from heaven against all godlessness and
wickedness of people who suppress the truth. How can we understand and explain the
justification of God's wrath in a contemporary context where the idea of divine wrath
might be challenging or misunderstood?
3. How does Paul establish that God's wrath is not arbitrary but is directed specifically at
human actions that involve suppressing the truth? Discuss examples of how truth is
suppressed in society today and relate this to the concept of divine retribution.
4. Considering the nature of God's wrath as revealed, justified, and rightly directed, how
should this influence the behavior and beliefs of Christians today? How can believers
reconcile the concept of a loving God with the reality of God's wrath?

## Next Steps

wrath and thank Him that He has forgiven you and adopted you into His family.
