## Ice breaker question
What is the best fruit?

## Main Idea:
Remember Warnings & Stand Firm in The Face of Danger

## Jude 17-23 
17 But you must remember, beloved, the predictions of the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ. 18 They said to you, "In the last time there will be scoffers, following their own ungodly passions." 19 It is these who cause divisions, worldly people, devoid of the Spirit. 20 But you, beloved, building yourselves up in your most holy faith and praying in the Holy Spirit, 21 keep yourselves in the love of God, waiting for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ that leads to eternal life.

## Discussion Questions
1. Share a time when you experienced divisions or conflicts within a community, whether it was a church, workplace, or even a friendship. How did it affect you and those involved?

2. Read Jude 17-19. What warnings are given in these verses? Why is it important for believers to be aware of these predictions?

3. Verse 19 mentions that these divisive individuals are "devoid of the Spirit." What do you think it means to be "devoid of the Spirit"? How can we discern whether someone is operating in the flesh or guided by the Holy Spirit?

4. Read Jude 20-21. What instructions are given to believers in order to counteract the influence of the scoffers and stay firm in their faith? How can we practically apply these instructions in our lives today?

5. Reflect on the phrase "keep yourselves in the love of God" from verse 21. How does this concept align with God's unconditional love for us? How can we actively pursue and abide in God's love?

6. Verse 22-23 talk about showing mercy to those who doubt and rescuing others from the fire. How can we demonstrate mercy to those who have been influenced by false teachings or are struggling in their faith? How can we balance mercy and truth in our interactions with others?

## Next Steps: 
This week work on balancing mercy and truth: Strive to maintain a balance between extending mercy and upholding the truth of God's Word. Speak the truth in love, offering correction or guidance when necessary, while also demonstrating compassion, grace, and understanding.
## Prayer Focus:
Pray for discernment to recognize false teachings and divisive influences. Ask God for wisdom to apply His instructions and to be effective in showing mercy to those in need., and in seeking His guidance in demonstrating mercy, compassion, and love to those who doubt or are affected by false teachings.
