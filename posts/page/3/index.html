Discussion Questions What insight, principle, or observation from this week‚Äôs sermon was the most helpful, eye- opening, or troubling? Explain. Discuss instances in your life where maintaining the right attitude as a servant was challenging. How did you handle those situations? How can the principle of being a faithful and humble servant impact our relationships with others? Reflect on the concept of service without expecting recognition or reward. How can this mindset contribute to a godly attitude? How can we encourage one another in our journey to maintain the right attitude as godly servants? Next Steps This week, take the time to think about what attitude you most consistently display in serving the Lord.

Discussion Questions What insight, principle, or observation from this week‚Äôs sermon was the most helpful, eye- opening, or troubling? Explain. Read verses 1-13. What are some things that you find significant in those verses? Discuss what you‚Äôve found and why those insights are important. Joshua commanded the people to serve the Lord‚Äîare we under the same command? Why or why not? Joshua made a choice for himself and his family and challenged Israel to do the same. If you choose not to serve the Lord, what does your choice reveal about your heart and life? Read Luke 9:23. Is there a difference between serving and following Jesus? What does He say about serving Him on our terms? Next Steps Serve the Lord is the theme for 2024 at CrossPointe Church. Take inventory this week of your service to the Lord through the church.

Why do you think people find it difficult to consider and include God in their daily plans?
What helpful habits do you think could help us remember and recognize God‚Äôs sovereignty over our lives?

Read: James 4:6-12 Bible app link
Discussion Questions What insight, principle, or observation from this week‚Äôs sermon was the most helpful, eyeopening, or troubling? Explain. James issued eleven commands in this section. Which of these commands do you struggle with the most? Read verse seven. How do the actions of submitting to God and resisting the devil relate to one another, and what are some ways you can resist the devil? Read verse nine. Why is genuine repentance essential in our relationship with God? How can we cultivate a repentant heart? In verse twelve, James warns against judging others. What do you think he means by this? How can we be discerning but not go over the line in our attitude and interactions with others? Next Steps How does God‚Äôs grace impact your life every day? Meditate on verses 7-10 this week and evaluate how you respond to the grace you‚Äôve received. And be sure to vote on Tuesday!

Read: James 4:1-5 Bible app link
Discussion Questions What insight, principle, or observation from this week‚Äôs sermon did you find to be the most helpful, eye-opening, or troubling? Explain. James wanted his readers to understand that selfishness‚Äîwhich is a result of adopting worldly wisdom‚Äîwill always destroy peace. Name some ways this is true in different aspects of life. One of the issues that James addresses in this text is that we are prone to covet or envy. What is envy and how is this dangerous attitude expressed in your life and in our culture? Thinking about the sermon last week and the text we‚Äôre studying this week, discuss some practical ways you can address selfishness and envy in your life. What does it mean to be a friend of the world? Why is it not possible to be friends with the world and faithful to God? How can the fact that God ‚Äúyears jealously‚Äù over you help you overcome the serious issues that James addresses in this text? Next Steps We all struggle with selfishness and conflict. This week read through Galatians 5:22-26 and think about how the Fruit of the Spirit helps us overcome the sins that cause conflict and division.

Read: James 3:1-12 Bible app link
Discussion Questions What insight, principle, or observation from this week‚Äôs sermon did you find to be the most helpful, eye-opening, or troubling? Explain. Provide examples of worldly and godly wisdom. How do we often confuse these two and how often have you consulted worldly wisdom over the last month? Not all sources of wisdom are equally valid, so how do you determine what wisdom to follow? Most people search for wisdom in one of the following places: Senses-What I feel; Self-What I think; Society-What others think; or Scripture-What God thinks. Which of these sources do you depend on the most? If you said something other than Scripture, then how is it worldly in the way that James describes? Earthly wisdom is sensual and demonic. What do these words mean and how does this help us recognize worldly wisdom? Read verses 3:17-18. James lists eight traits of heavenly wisdom. Identify and define them together as a group. Next Steps Godly wisdom is vital for believers to follow. Read Psalm 1:1-6 this week to discover where you can find godly wisdom. Also, read 1 Corinthians 1:18-25 and consider how the cross of Christ is the apex of wisdom.

Read: James 2:14-26 Bible app link
Discussion Questions Define clearly the issue in 2:14. Why would people claim to have genuine faith if they don‚Äôt? What might motivate this kind of deception (or self-delusion) in our world today? James attacks cold, intellectual belief in 2:19-20. Illustrate this kind of ‚Äúheady‚Äù approach to Christianity with a couple of modern examples. In what ways do you tend to intellectualize rather than actualize your faith? This week Big Idea The things you say, matter.
