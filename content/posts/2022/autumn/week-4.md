## Announcements
• Faith Promise Commitment Sunday is next Sunday. We will not be collecting
commitment cards, but we do ask that you and your family will commit to help fund
our mission efforts.

• Secure the Knot is this coming Saturday. October 23rd is the last day to register for
this important event.

## Big Idea
Life under the sun is complex but doesn’t have to be complicated if you fear God and
obey His commandments.

## Read: Ecclesiastes 12:8-14
Vanity of vanities, says the Preacher; all is vanity.
9Besides being wise, the Preacher also taught the people knowledge, weighing and studying and arranging many proverbs with great care. 10The Preacher sought to find words of delight, and uprightly he wrote words of truth.
11 The words of the wise are like goads, and like nails firmly fixed are the collected sayings; they are given by one Shepherd. 12My son, beware of anything beyond these. Of making many books there is no end, and much study is a weariness of the flesh.
13The end of the matter; all has been heard. Fear God and keep his commandments, for this is the whole duty of man. 14For God will bring every deed into judgment, with every secret thing, whether good or evil.

## Discussion Questions
1. What was the most impactful thing from the text and the sermon this week?
2. Read vs. 10-11. How do these verses apply to the entirety of Scripture? Discuss
how this text instructs us to respond to God’s Word.
3. Read vs. 12. What are some problems of accepting wisdom that is not from
Scripture? What are some principles we can use to discern if extra-biblical wisdom
should be followed or rejected?
4. Read vs. 13-14. Discuss the ways these verses motivate us to live on mission
and give to missions.
5. What is one major takeaway you’ve learned from our study in Ecclesiastes?

## Next Steps
Sunday is Faith Promise Commitment Sunday. Please think about and pray over the
amount you’ll commit to God to give (beyond your regular offerings and One Vision
commitment) over the next twelve months to local and global missions.
## Prayer Focus
Please pray this week for our missionaries John and Tammy Cooley who are sent from
CrossPointe and serving in Jamaica.
