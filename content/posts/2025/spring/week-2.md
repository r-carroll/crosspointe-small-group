[Romans 8:26-27](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/ROM.8.ESV)

## Questions
1. When you consider the Spirit’s role in helping us in our weakness, how does
that reshape your view of what qualifies as a “strong” or “effective” prayer
life?
2. Have you ever experienced a time when you didn’t know how to pray or what
to pray for? How might this passage help reframe those moments?
3. What do you think it means that the Spirit intercedes “according to the will
of God”? How does that truth give you peace when your prayers feel
uncertain or incomplete?
4. How might a deeper trust in the Spirit’s help change the way you engage in
prayer—both privately and with others?

## Next Steps
Memorize Romans 8:26–27 to remind
yourself daily that you are never alone
in prayer.

## Prayer focus
Ask the Spirit to teach you how to rely
on His intercession and lead you into
deeper trust in your prayer life.
