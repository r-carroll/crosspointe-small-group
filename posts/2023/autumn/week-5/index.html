to one another, and what are some ways you can resist the devil?
Read verse nine. Why is genuine repentance essential in our relationship with God? How can
we cultivate a repentant heart?
In verse twelve, James warns against judging others. What do you think he means by this?
How can we be discerning but not go over the line in our attitude and interactions with
others?
