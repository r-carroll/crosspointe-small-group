Amen.\nDiscussion Questions Share personal experiences of how God has kept you from stumbling or helped you grow in your faith despite facing trials and temptations. What is a doxology, and why is it significant that Jude ends his letter with one? How does this closing doxology shape our perspective on God’s character and what He has done for us? The first reality presented in the text is that believers are “kept by the power of God.” How does the assurance of God’s preserving power impact your faith and daily walk with Him? The second reality mentioned is that believers will be presented “blameless before the presence of His glory with great joy.” How does the hope of being blameless in God’s presence encourage you, especially in times of struggle and temptation? Discuss the concept of eternal security and the idea of once saved, always saved. How does the knowledge that God holds onto us and completes the work He started bring comfort and assurance? Consider the connection between preserving our faith and actively keeping ourselves in the love of God. How do these two aspects work together in our Christian walk? Next Steps: This is a message that you will need to be reminded of often. Think about your habits and the people you have around you and evaluate their influence on you. Reflect on how God has kept you, and thank Him for His faithfulness in your life.\nPrayer Focus: Thank God for keeping you from stumbling. The Lord will keep us and will present us in His holy presence faultless with great joy. It is in that confident expression that our worship is rendered to Yahweh and we praise Him in Jesus’s name. Amen.\n","wordCount":"360","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-07-30T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-07-30T00:00:00Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://smallgroup.carrollmedia.dev/posts/2023/summer/week-5/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Small Group Notes","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://smallgroup.carrollmedia.dev/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><script src=/prayer.js></script><script>window.onload=init</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://smallgroup.carrollmedia.dev/ accesskey=h title="Small Group Notes (Alt + H)">Small Group Notes</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a class=float-right href=/prayer-tracker>Prayer &#128591;</a></li></ul></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><h1 class=post-title>Jude - Week 5</h1><div class=post-meta>&lt;span title='2023-07-30 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>July 30, 2023&lt;/span></div></header><div class=post-content><h2 id=main-idea>Main Idea:<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#main-idea>#</a></h2><p>You can trust that God is able to keep you from stumbling and present you blameless before
