Discussion Questions

Define clearly the issue in 2:14. Why would people claim to have genuine faith if they
don’t? What might motivate this kind of deception (or self-delusion) in our world today?
James attacks cold, intellectual belief in 2:19-20. Illustrate this kind of “heady” approach
to Christianity with a couple of modern examples. In what ways do you tend to
intellectualize rather than actualize your faith?

According to James, what does the tongue reveal about our hearts and our minds? What do our words have to do with being a mature person? Why do you think James considered the tongue uncontrollable by our strength alone? Next Steps How often do you think about the fact that everything you say, and think reflects your heart?

Note: Be sure to get your tickets to the Food Truck Fair this coming Sunday!\nRabbit trail In James 1:4, is James saying it’s possible to live a sinless life? Certainly not! Here are a few brief points to support how and why the passages in James are referring to completeness and maturity regarding the Christian life and not indicating that sinless perfection is possible.\nLanguage This is perhaps the strongest “proof” that it is referring more to maturity. In the original Greek text, the word used for “perfect” in James 1:4 is “τέλειοι” (teleioi), derived from the root “τέλειος” (teleios). This term conveys the idea of completeness, maturity, or reaching a goal.\nAnalysis of the word teleios Bible study tools Context The overall narrative in James provides context for interpreting the meaning of “perfect.” In James 1:2-4, the emphasis is on the process of maturing and enduring trials with joy, which ultimately leads to completeness. The word “teleioi” is used in the sense of becoming more mature in faith through the testing of one’s faith. James 1:2-3 states, “Count it all joy, my brothers, when you meet trials of various kinds, for you know that the testing of your faith produces steadfastness.” The focus here is on spiritual growth and development.\n","wordCount":"444","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-10-15T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-10-15T00:00:00Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://smallgroup.carrollmedia.dev/posts/2023/autumn/week-2/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Small Group Notes","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://smallgroup.carrollmedia.dev/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://smallgroup.carrollmedia.dev/ accesskey=h title="Small Group Notes (Alt + H)">Small Group Notes</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button><ul class=lang-switch><li>|</li></ul></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a class=float-right href=/reading-tracker>Reading 📚</a></li></ul></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Can That Faith Save? & The Truth About The Tongue</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-10-15 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>October 15, 2023</span></div></header><div class=post-content><h1 id=last-week>Last week<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#last-week>#</a></h1><h2 id=big-idea>Big Idea<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#big-idea>#</a></h2><p>Any faith that does not produce works is worthless.</p><h2 id=read-james-214-26>Read: James 2:14-26<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#read-james-214-26>#</a></h2><p><a href=https://www.bible.com/bible/59/JAS.2.ESV>Bible app link</a></p><h2 id=discussion-questions>Discussion Questions<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#discussion-questions>#</a></h2><ol><li>Define clearly the issue in 2:14.
