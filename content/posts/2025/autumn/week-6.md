## Scripture
[Romans 11:25-32](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/ROM.11.ESV)

## Icebreaker Question
What’s a time in your life when things looked hopeless, but later you could see how
God was working behind the scenes?

## Questions
1. In verses 25–27, Paul describes a “mystery” about the future salvation of
Israel. Why does it matter that God has not rejected Israel?
2. Paul says Israel is simultaneously “beloved” and “enemies” in verses 28–29.
How can both of these be true?
3. Verse 32 says that “God has consigned all to disobedience, that He may have
mercy on all.” What does this reveal about human need and divine grace?
4. How should believers respond when they don’t understand how God’s plan is
unfolding—in the world or in their personal lives?

## Next Steps 
Identify one area of life where you’ve
doubted God’s faithfulness. Find a specific
promise in Scripture that speaks to that
doubt. Pray for the Spirit's help to trust His
Word, even when His ways remain hidden.

## Prayer Focus

Praise God for His faithfulness to every
promise. Pray that He would deepen our trust
in His character, make us patient with His
timing, and move us to proclaim His mercy
with compassion to those far from faith
