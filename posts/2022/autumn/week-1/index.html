Solomon said wisdom helps one to succeed or gives someone an advantage. Talk about the ways wisdom helps God’s people succeed—can you name specific examples from Scripture? Read verses 12-14. What are some ways you can know the difference between wise and foolish speech? Read verses 16-17. Solomon talked about foolish government leaders. How can you determine if government leaders are acting wisely or foolishly? How are we, as disciples of Christ, to respond to foolish political leaders? Next Steps This week read Ecclesiastes 11:1-6 as you prepare for the upcoming Lord’s Day and consider what it means for you to live boldly by faith.\nPrayer Focus October is Mission Emphasis month at CrossPointe. Spend time this week praying for missionaries Ron and Nancy Minton who serve in Ukraine. Pray also that the people of CrossPointe will demonstrate radical generosity in giving to missions over the next year.\n","wordCount":"508","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-10-02T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-10-02T00:00:00Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://smallgroup.carrollmedia.dev/posts/2022/autumn/week-1/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Small Group Notes","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://smallgroup.carrollmedia.dev/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://smallgroup.carrollmedia.dev/ accesskey=h title="Small Group Notes (Alt + H)">Small Group Notes</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><h1 class=post-title>The World Turned Upside Down</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2022-10-02 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>October 2, 2022</span></div></header><div class=post-content><h2 id=big-idea>Big Idea<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#big-idea>#</a></h2><p>Life is filled with risk, so choose wisdom over foolishness.</p><h2 id=read-ecclesiastes-104-20>Read: Ecclesiastes 10:4-20<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#read-ecclesiastes-104-20>#</a></h2><p>If the anger of the ruler rises against you, do not leave your place,

5There is an evil that I have seen under the sun, as it were an error proceeding from the ruler: 6folly is set in many high places, and the rich sit in a low place. 7I have seen slaves on horses, and princes walking on the ground like slaves.
8He who digs a pit will fall into it,
and a serpent will bite him who breaks through a wall.
9 He who quarries stones is hurt by them,
and he who splits logs is endangered by them.
10If the iron is blunt, and one does not sharpen the edge,
he must use more strength,
but wisdom helps one to succeed.
11If the serpent bites before it is charmed,
there is no advantage to the charmer.
12The words of a wise man’s mouth win him favor,
but the lips of a fool consume him.
13The beginning of the words of his mouth is foolishness,
and the end of his talk is evil madness.
14 A fool multiplies words,
though no man knows what is to be,
and who can tell him what will be after him?
15The toil of a fool wearies him,
for he does not know the way to the city.
16 Woe to you, O land, when your king is a child,
and your princes feast in the morning!
17Happy are you, O land, when your king is the son of the nobility,
and your princes feast at the proper time,
for strength, and not for drunkenness!
18Through sloth the roof sinks in,
and through indolence the house leaks.
19Bread is made for laughter,
and wine gladdens life,
and money answers everything.
20Even in your thoughts, do not curse the king,
nor in your bedroom curse the rich,
for a bird of the air will carry your voice,
or some winged creature tell the matter.</p><h2 id=discussion-questions>Discussion Questions<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#discussion-questions>#</a></h2><ol><li>What was the most impactful thing from the text and the sermon this week?</li><li>Solomon said wisdom helps one to succeed or gives someone an advantage.
