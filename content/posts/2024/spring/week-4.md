Romans: Volume 1 - Week 4 | Week of April 28, 2024
Everyone needs to hear the gospel. Read: Romans 1:16-17
Discussion Questions
1. How does Paul describe the power of the gospel in Romans 1:16, and what implications does this have for how we view and share the gospel with others?
2. Paul emphasizes that the gospel is for "everyone who believes" (Romans 1:16). How does this universal call to belief challenge or reinforce our understanding of who needs salvation and who can receive it?
3. Romans 1:17 states, "In it the righteousness of God is revealed from faith to faith." How does understanding this righteousness as the righteousness God imputes to believers change our view of personal moral achievement and the basis of our salvation?
4. Considering that the gospel reveals both God's power to save and man's need for salvation, how should this dual revelation shape our understanding of evangelism and discipleship in relation to human responsibility and God's sovereignty?
Next Steps
Is there someone you know who needs to hear the gospel? Will you commit to going to them as soon as possible to share the good news that they can be made right with God?
