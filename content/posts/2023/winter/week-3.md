## Big Idea
God is available and ready to hear His people who seek Him through prayer.

## Read: Psalm 5:1-12
To the choirmaster: for the flutes. A Psalm of David.
5 Give ear to my words, O Lord;
    consider my groaning.
2 Give attention to the sound of my cry,
    my King and my God,
    for to you do I pray.
3 O Lord, in the morning you hear my voice;
    in the morning I prepare a sacrifice for you[a] and watch.

4 For you are not a God who delights in wickedness;
    evil may not dwell with you.
5 The boastful shall not stand before your eyes;
    you hate all evildoers.
6 You destroy those who speak lies;
    the Lord abhors the bloodthirsty and deceitful man.

7 But I, through the abundance of your steadfast love,
    will enter your house.
I will bow down toward your holy temple
    in the fear of you.
8 Lead me, O Lord, in your righteousness
    because of my enemies;
    make your way straight before me.

9 For there is no truth in their mouth;
    their inmost self is destruction;
their throat is an open grave;
    they flatter with their tongue.
10 Make them bear their guilt, O God;
    let them fall by their own counsels;
because of the abundance of their transgressions cast them out,
    for they have rebelled against you.

11 But let all who take refuge in you rejoice;
    let them ever sing for joy,
and spread your protection over them,
    that those who love your name may exult in you.
12 For you bless the righteous, O Lord;
    you cover him with favor as with a shield.

## Discussion Questions
1. What was the most impactful thing from the text and the sermon this week?
2. Many Christians struggle with prayer. Is praying a struggle for you? If so, why do
you believe you struggle. If not, how did you grow in this discipline?
3. Read verse two. Why are David’s words significant and what can we learn from
this verse about seeking the Lord in prayer?
4. Twice in this prayer David acknowledged wicked people. What do verses 4-6
and 9-10 teach us about sin and a sinner’s position with God?
5. Prayer should bring about rejoicing in your life. Look over the entire Psalm once
again and identify some reasons to rejoice in God.

## Next Steps
This week, record how much time you spend seeking the Lord through prayer. Based
on what you find, can you say that prayer is a priority in your life?

## Prayer Focus
Continue to pray for Jenna, Kenley, Cohen, and Ivy Beer as they mourn. Pray for God
to comfort them and provide peace to their souls.
