## Scripture:
[Psalm 32](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/PSA.32.ESV)

## Small Group Discussion
1. What stood out to you from the sermon this week?
2. This weekâ€™s message focused on a psalm. Is there a psalm you have found to be particularly
meaningful in your walk with the Lord?
3. Many people today fail to acknowledge with their minds what is true. What are some
examples of this?
4. Reread Psalm 32:8-9. What is the contrast between humans and animals in these verses?
Why is this significant?
5. How might a failure to engage your mind affect your service to God?

## Next Steps:
Throughout the week, reflect on the many blessings which come from the gift God has
given humankind of minds to reason and understand.
