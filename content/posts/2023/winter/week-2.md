## Big Idea
The Word of God is needed for spiritual life and development.

## Read: 1 Peter 1:22-2:3
22 Having purified your souls by your obedience to the truth for a sincere brotherly love, love one another earnestly from a pure heart, 23 since you have been born again, not of perishable seed but of imperishable, through the living and abiding word of God; 24 for

“All flesh is like grass
    and all its glory like the flower of grass.
The grass withers,
    and the flower falls,
25 but the word of the Lord remains forever.”

And this word is the good news that was preached to you.

Ch2 So put away all malice and all deceit and hypocrisy and envy and all slander. 2 Like newborn infants, long for the pure spiritual milk, that by it you may grow up into salvation— 3 if indeed you have tasted that the Lord is good.

## Discussion Questions
1. What was the most impactful thing from the text and the sermon this week?
2. In verse 23, Peter grounds the New Birth in the imperishable seed. What does this
mean and how does this truth give us hope?
3. According to the text, how should the relationship between our new birth and our
love for one another be obvious?
4. What would you say to a person who claims they can seek the Lord
independent of the Bible? Give reasons for your answer.
5. Read 2:3 and then 2:1. How does the goodness of the Lord change how we
think about ourselves and others?

## Next Steps
This week, record how much time you spend seeking the Lord through His Word. Based
on what you find, can you say that reading the Bible is a priority in your life?

## Prayer Focus
We cannot change ourselves, but we change as we are continually exposed to the
goodness of God. Therefore, pray that God will open your eyes to His kindness and
mercy every time you read the Bible.
