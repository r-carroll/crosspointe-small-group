## Scripture
[Exodus 14:10-14](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/EXO.14.ESV)

## Icebreaker Question
What is something that caused you anxiety in childhood that seems less important
today?

## Questions
1. Read Exodus 14:10–14 together. What is the contrast between Moses’s
response and that of the people?
2. What are specific moments when God has provided for or protected you?
How can remembering those moments help build your trust today?
3. Moses said,
“The Lord will fight for you, and you have only to be silent.” Why
do you think he told the people to be silent?

4. Read Philippians 4:4-9. In verse 6, Paul charges his readers not to be anxious.
How can his further directives in verses 8-9 help with following that charge?

## Next Steps 
Select a passage of Scripture to memorize so
that you can meditate on it when anxieties
come.
Make a list of things God has done for you.
Keep it handy so you can review it when
doubts come.

## Prayer Focus
That God would help us remember what He’s
done for us in the past.
That God would forgive us for giving in to fear.
