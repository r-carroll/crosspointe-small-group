Text: Judges 2:1-15
Discussion Questions What stood out to you, made you think, or was something that you liked, or remember from the sermon? Or What are you excited about, if anything, in studying the book of Judges? How did the Israelites disregard God? With consideration to question 2, how does it look for ‚Äúmodern day‚Äù Christians to disregard God in the same way? Pastor Matt quoted his mother, ‚ÄúIf you play with the pigs you‚Äôll eventually end up smelling like them‚Äù what did she mean and how does or can that relate to us today and to this passage? What were the three challenges that were given at the close of the message and how can we practically apply them to our lives today? Next Steps: Examine question number 5 and search your life this week and ask the Holy Spirit to point out in your personal life where you need to apply this week‚Äôs message. Where are you disregarding God in your life and how can and will you change it?

Money should not control our hearts and lives but rather God should. Money then is a temporary gift that God gives us to serve him to the absolute fullest measure we can in this life. We should steward our resources and money and use them to serve others, the church, and the mission of the church is to further the kingdom of God.

Questions Who has God used to pass the good deposit on to you? How have they invested in you? Read Paul‚Äôs ‚Äútrustworthy sayings‚Äù: 1 Timothy 1:15, 3:1, 4:8-9; 2 Timothy 2:11-13. What does his emphasis on sayings like these tell us about what it means to follow God? In 1 Timothy 4:16, Paul tells Timothy, ‚ÄúKeep a close watch on yourself and on the teaching.‚Äù Read this in context (start in verse 6). What practical tips does Paul give Timothy for how to keep a watch on himself and the teaching? How can you build these into your life? What are possible stumbling blocks that might prevent you from effectively passing on the good deposit to others? Next Steps Reach out to someone who has discipled you in the faith. Thank him or her, for sharing specific ways in which God has used this person in your life. Prayer Focus If you‚Äôre already dicipleing others in the faith, ask God for continued wisdom so that your efforts will be even more effective. If you can‚Äôt think of anyone you‚Äôre mentoring, pray that God would show you people in your sphere of influence who would benefit from this. And pray that He would lead you as you begin to lead these individuals.</p></div><footer class=entry-footer><span title='2024-02-11 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>February 11, 2024</span></footer><a class=entry-link aria-label="post link to Guard the Good Deposit" href=https://smallgroup.carrollmedia.dev/posts/2024/winter/week-5/></a></article><article class=post-entry><header class=entry-header><h2 class=entry-hint-parent>Take Care How You Build & Life of a Steward</h2></header><div class=entry-content><p>Take Care How You Build Read: 1 Corinthians 3:10-15
Malachi 1
Discussion Questions Where in this passage could you point to correct someone who suggests we are saved by works? What are some other passages of Scripture which more explicitly correct this thinking? How should knowing that God will reward believers‚Äô service affect how we live?

Read: Luke 17:7-10
Discussion Questions What insight, principle, or observation from this week‚Äôs sermon was the most helpful, eye- opening, or troubling? Explain. Discuss instances in your life where maintaining the right attitude as a servant was challenging. How did you handle those situations? How can the principle of being a faithful and humble servant impact our relationships with others? Reflect on the concept of service without expecting recognition or reward. How can this mindset contribute to a godly attitude? How can we encourage one another in our journey to maintain the right attitude as godly servants? Next Steps This week, take the time to think about what attitude you most consistently display in serving the Lord.

Read: Joshua 24:14-15
Discussion Questions What insight, principle, or observation from this week‚Äôs sermon was the most helpful, eye- opening, or troubling? Explain. Read verses 1-13. What are some things that you find significant in those verses? Discuss what you‚Äôve found and why those insights are important. Joshua commanded the people to serve the Lord‚Äîare we under the same command? Why or why not? Joshua made a choice for himself and his family and challenged Israel to do the same. If you choose not to serve the Lord, what does your choice reveal about your heart and life? Read Luke 9:23. Is there a difference between serving and following Jesus? What does He say about serving Him on our terms? Next Steps Serve the Lord is the theme for 2024 at CrossPointe Church. Take inventory this week of your service to the Lord through the church.

Read: James 4:6-12 Bible app link
Discussion Questions What insight, principle, or observation from this week‚Äôs sermon was the most helpful, eyeopening, or troubling? Explain. James issued eleven commands in this section. Which of these commands do you struggle with the most? Read verse seven. How do the actions of submitting to God and resisting the devil relate to one another, and what are some ways you can resist the devil? Read verse nine. Why is genuine repentance essential in our relationship with God? How can we cultivate a repentant heart? In verse twelve, James warns against judging others. What do you think he means by this? How can we be discerning but not go over the line in our attitude and interactions with others? Next Steps How does God‚Äôs grace impact your life every day? Meditate on verses 7-10 this week and evaluate how you respond to the grace you‚Äôve received. And be sure to vote on Tuesday!
