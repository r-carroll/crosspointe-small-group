## Big Idea
Every believer is united with Christ for a purpose.

## Read: 
Romans [6:5-11](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/ROM.6.ESV)

## Discussion Questions
1. What insight, principle, or observation from this week’s sermon was the most helpful, eye-
opening, or troubling? Explain.

2. How do secular and biblical perspectives on identity differ?
3. What does it mean to be “united with Christ” as described by Paul in verses five through
eleven?
4. On two occasions, Paul said “we know” (vs. 6, 9). He clearly wanted us to not only know
about our union with Christ but to embrace the reality of that union. Sometimes we don’t
feel as if these things are true, so what role does faith play in our new identity in Christ?
5. How does this passage and sermon change the way we think about freedom?

## Next Steps
As members of the body of Christ, what are some practical ways we can encourage one another
to live in the reality of being dead to sin and alive to God?
