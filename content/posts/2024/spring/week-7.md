## Big Idea
Those who oppose God invite destruction. 

## Read: 
[Romans 1:19-32](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/ROM.1.ESV)

## Discussion Questions
1. Romans 1:24-25 explains that God turns people over to their selfish desires due to their rejection of Him. How do these selfish desires manifest in today's society, and what are some examples of how they lead to personal and societal destruction?
2. In Romans 1:26-27, Paul describes God turning people over to unnatural activities due to their opposition to Him. What are some contemporary examples of such activities, and how do they contribute to the moral decay and destruction in individuals' lives and society as a whole?
3. Romans 1:28-32 details how God turns people over to depraved thinking due to their persistent rejection of Him. How does this depraved thinking manifest in behavior, and what are the consequences for both individuals and communities?
4. Considering the progression described in Romans 1:24-32—from selfish desires to unnatural activities to depraved thinking—how can recognizing these stages help us understand the destructive path of opposing God?

## Next Steps
It’s easy for us to begin to think that we are what’s right with society and, as a result, begin to despise those whose behavior is described in this passage. Yet, we must remain humble if we are to be compassionate and effective in sharing the gospel. This week, read and meditate on the message of 1 Corinthians 6:9-11.

## Prayer Focus
