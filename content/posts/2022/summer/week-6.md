## Big Idea
We must remind ourselves to wait and trust in God’s power, love, and justice in all circumstances rather than our own
intellect and power, because God alone is Sovereign.

## Scripture reading
Psalm 62
> For God alone my soul waits in silence; from him comes my salvation. 2 He alone is my rock and my
> salvation, my fortress; I shall not be greatly shaken. 3 How long will all of you attack a man to batter him,
> like a leaning wall, a tottering fence? 4 They only plan to thrust him down from his high position. They
> take pleasure in falsehood. They bless with their mouths, but inwardly they curse. Selah 5 For God alone,
> O my soul, wait in silence, for my hope is from him. 6 He only is my rock and my salvation, my fortress; I
> shall not be shaken. 7 On God rests my salvation and my glory; my mighty rock, my refuge is God. 8 Trust
> in him at all times, O people; pour out your heart before him; God is a refuge for us. Selah 9 Those of low
> estate are but a breath; those of high estate are a delusion; in the balances they go up; they are together
> lighter than a breath. 10 Put no trust in extortion; set no vain hopes on robbery; if riches increase, set not
> your heart on them. 11 Once God has spoken; twice have I heard this that power belongs to God, 12 and
> that to you, O Lord, belongs steadfast love. For you will render to a man according to his work.

## Next Steps
Take time this week in your devotional time to pour out your heart before God by writing your own psalm. If you are
willing, share it with your group the following week.

## Prayer Focus
Pour out your heart to God. As you pray this week tell God everything on your heart. Tell Him your goals, dreams,
desires, frustrations, fears, and gratitudes. Tell Him how you feel about Him, and what you think about Him. Ask God
to show you areas in your life that you aren’t trusting in Him alone for
