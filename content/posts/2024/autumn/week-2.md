## Big Idea
Christians do not take advantage of God’s grace; we are transformed by God’s grace.

## Read:
[Romans 6:1-4](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/ROM.6.ESV)

## Discussion Questions
1. What insight, principle, or observation from this week’s sermon was the most helpful, eyeopening, or troubling? Explain.
2. How would you explain the difference between being transformed by God's grace and
taking advantage of it?
3. Read Romans 6:1-2. Why does Paul ask, "Shall we go on sinning so that grace may
increase?" How does this challenge any misconceptions about grace?
4. According to Romans 6:3-4, how does being united with Christ in His death and
resurrection empower us to live a new life?
5. What does it mean to "walk in newness of life" as stated in verse 4? How does grace make
this possible?

## Next Steps
Consider how your small group can support each other to embrace the transformative power of grace and
live in righteousness. Discuss this as you conclude your group time this week.

## Prayer Focus
This is Mission Emphasis Month at CrossPointe. This week, focus on the need for people to serve at
CrossPointe and pray for members to surrender to meet the need.
