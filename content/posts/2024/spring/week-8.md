## Big Idea
Every person deserves to be judged by God. 

## Read: 
[Romans 2:1-4](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/ROM.2.ESV)


## Discussion Questions
1. How does Romans 2:1-4 address the issue of self-righteous judgment?
2. What role does God's kindness play in His judgment according to Romans 2:4?
3. How does Paul address moralists in Romans 2:1-3, and what broader message does he convey about sin and judgment through this approach?
4. What warning does the sermon give about presuming upon God's mercy, and what should be our correct response to God's patience and kindness?


## Next Steps
Consider how the awareness of your own guilt before God and the understanding of His mercy can transform your daily interactions and your overall perspective on life. Let this passage challenge you to live authentically, humbly acknowledging your need for grace and extending that grace to others.
