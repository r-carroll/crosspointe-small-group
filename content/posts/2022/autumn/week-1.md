## Big Idea
Life is filled with risk, so choose wisdom over foolishness.

## Read: Ecclesiastes 10:4-20
If the anger of the ruler rises against you, do not leave your place,
for calmness will lay great offenses to rest.
5There is an evil that I have seen under the sun, as it were an error proceeding from the ruler: 6folly is set in many high places, and the rich sit in a low place. 7I have seen slaves on horses, and princes walking on the ground like slaves.
8He who digs a pit will fall into it,
and a serpent will bite him who breaks through a wall.
9 He who quarries stones is hurt by them,
and he who splits logs is endangered by them.
10If the iron is blunt, and one does not sharpen the edge,
he must use more strength,
but wisdom helps one to succeed.
11If the serpent bites before it is charmed,
there is no advantage to the charmer.
12The words of a wise man’s mouth win him favor,
but the lips of a fool consume him.
13The beginning of the words of his mouth is foolishness,
and the end of his talk is evil madness.
14 A fool multiplies words,
though no man knows what is to be,
and who can tell him what will be after him?
15The toil of a fool wearies him,
for he does not know the way to the city.
16 Woe to you, O land, when your king is a child,
and your princes feast in the morning!
17Happy are you, O land, when your king is the son of the nobility,
and your princes feast at the proper time,
for strength, and not for drunkenness!
18Through sloth the roof sinks in,
and through indolence the house leaks.
19Bread is made for laughter,
and wine gladdens life,
and money answers everything.
20Even in your thoughts, do not curse the king,
nor in your bedroom curse the rich,
for a bird of the air will carry your voice,
or some winged creature tell the matter.

## Discussion Questions
1. What was the most impactful thing from the text and the sermon this week?
2. Solomon said wisdom helps one to succeed or gives someone an advantage. Talk
about the ways wisdom helps God’s people succeed—can you name specific
examples from Scripture?
3. Read verses 12-14. What are some ways you can know the difference between
wise and foolish speech?
4. Read verses 16-17. Solomon talked about foolish government leaders. How can
you determine if government leaders are acting wisely or foolishly? How are
we, as disciples of Christ, to respond to foolish political leaders?

## Next Steps
This week read Ecclesiastes 11:1-6 as you prepare for the upcoming Lord’s Day and
consider what it means for you to live boldly by faith.

## Prayer Focus
October is Mission Emphasis month at CrossPointe. Spend time this week praying for
missionaries Ron and Nancy Minton who serve in Ukraine. Pray also that the people of
CrossPointe will demonstrate radical generosity in giving to missions over the next year.
