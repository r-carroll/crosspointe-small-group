Read Romans 6:1-2. Why does Paul ask, &ldquo;Shall we go on sinning so that grace may
increase?&rdquo; How does this challenge any misconceptions about grace?
According to Romans 6:3-4, how does being united with Christ in His death and
resurrection empower us to live a new life?
What does it mean to &ldquo;walk in newness of life&rdquo; as stated in verse 4? How does grace make
