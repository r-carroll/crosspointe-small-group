Discussion Questions What insight, principle, or observation from this week’s sermon was the most helpful, eyeopening, or troubling? Explain. James issued eleven commands in this section. Which of these commands do you struggle with the most? Read verse seven. How do the actions of submitting to God and resisting the devil relate to one another, and what are some ways you can resist the devil? Read verse nine. Why is genuine repentance essential in our relationship with God? How can we cultivate a repentant heart? In verse twelve, James warns against judging others. What do you think he means by this? How can we be discerning but not go over the line in our attitude and interactions with others? Next Steps How does God’s grace impact your life every day? Meditate on verses 7-10 this week and evaluate how you respond to the grace you’ve received. And be sure to vote on Tuesday!

Read: James 4:1-5 Bible app link
Discussion Questions What insight, principle, or observation from this week’s sermon did you find to be the most helpful, eye-opening, or troubling? Explain. James wanted his readers to understand that selfishness—which is a result of adopting worldly wisdom—will always destroy peace. Name some ways this is true in different aspects of life. One of the issues that James addresses in this text is that we are prone to covet or envy. What is envy and how is this dangerous attitude expressed in your life and in our culture? Thinking about the sermon last week and the text we’re studying this week, discuss some practical ways you can address selfishness and envy in your life. What does it mean to be a friend of the world? Why is it not possible to be friends with the world and faithful to God? How can the fact that God “years jealously” over you help you overcome the serious issues that James addresses in this text? Next Steps We all struggle with selfishness and conflict. This week read through Galatians 5:22-26 and think about how the Fruit of the Spirit helps us overcome the sins that cause conflict and division.

Read: James 3:1-12 Bible app link
Discussion Questions What insight, principle, or observation from this week’s sermon did you find to be the most helpful, eye-opening, or troubling? Explain. Provide examples of worldly and godly wisdom. How do we often confuse these two and how often have you consulted worldly wisdom over the last month? Not all sources of wisdom are equally valid, so how do you determine what wisdom to follow? Most people search for wisdom in one of the following places: Senses-What I feel; Self-What I think; Society-What others think; or Scripture-What God thinks. Which of these sources do you depend on the most? If you said something other than Scripture, then how is it worldly in the way that James describes? Earthly wisdom is sensual and demonic. What do these words mean and how does this help us recognize worldly wisdom? Read verses 3:17-18. James lists eight traits of heavenly wisdom. Identify and define them together as a group. Next Steps Godly wisdom is vital for believers to follow. Read Psalm 1:1-6 this week to discover where you can find godly wisdom. Also, read 1 Corinthians 1:18-25 and consider how the cross of Christ is the apex of wisdom.

Read: James 2:14-26 Bible app link
Discussion Questions Define clearly the issue in 2:14. Why would people claim to have genuine faith if they don’t? What might motivate this kind of deception (or self-delusion) in our world today? James attacks cold, intellectual belief in 2:19-20. Illustrate this kind of “heady” approach to Christianity with a couple of modern examples. In what ways do you tend to intellectualize rather than actualize your faith? This week Big Idea The things you say, matter.

He must show courtesy to all, compassion for all, and consistency to all. Holding to the Faith in our Lord Jesus Christ, and fulfilling the royal law are key in a faith that works.
James 2:1-13 My brothers, show no partiality as you hold the faith in our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory. 2 For if a man wearing a gold ring and fine clothing comes into your assembly, and a poor man in shabby clothing also comes in, 3 and if you pay attention to the one who wears the fine clothing and say, “You sit here in a good place,” while you say to the poor man, “You stand over there,” or, “Sit down at my feet,” 4 have you not then made distinctions among yourselves and become judges with evil thoughts? 5 Listen, my beloved brothers, has not God chosen those who are poor in the world to be rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom, which he has promised to those who love him? 6 But you have dishonored the poor man. Are not the rich the ones who oppress you, and the ones who drag you into court? 7 Are they not the ones who blaspheme the honorable name by which you were called? 8 If you really fulfill the royal law according to the Scripture, “You shall love your neighbor as yourself,” you are doing well. 9 But if you show partiality, you are committing sin and are convicted by the law as transgressors. 10 For whoever keeps the whole law but fails in one point has become guilty of all of it. 11 For he who said, “Do not commit adultery,” also said, “Do not murder.” If you do not commit adultery but do murder, you have become a transgressor of the law. 12 So speak and so act as those who are to be judged under the law of liberty. 13 For judgment is without mercy to one who has shown no mercy. Mercy triumphs over judgment.

Read: 2 John 7-13
Discussion Questions What insight, principle, or observation from this week’s sermon did you find to be the most helpful, eye-opening, or troubling? Explain. Last week you were supposed to do a personal Bible study and look up all the instances where the apostle John wrote that we are to love one another. Discuss what you found. John issued three commands in this text, the first is “watch yourselves” (v.8). How do you watch yourselves to prevent falling prey to false teachers? Why is going beyond the Word of God so dangerous? Name some of the ways this strategy has been used to lead people astray. What is significant about verse twelve? Discuss how we should apply what John said to those believers to our walk with Christ? Next Steps Next week we will begin to walk through the book of James. Please read the book of James every day this week (5 chapters will take about 15-20 minutes) and prepare for this exciting study.

Read: 2 John 4-6
Discussion Questions What insight, principle, or observation from this week’s sermon did you find to be the most helpful, eye-opening, or troubling? Explain. Last week you were supposed to read 2 John and write out what you observed from the text. Discuss what you saw in your study of this short letter. Have you ever learned a valuable lesson because you weren’t walking in truth? If you’re comfortable, share with your group what happened and what you learned. John said we are to love one another, what other “___ one another” commands are given throughout scripture? Why do you think John often repeats the command of our Lord to love one another? Next Steps Do a personal Bible study this week and look up all the instances where the apostle John wrote that we are to love one another. Use a concordance or an online Bible study tool such as Logos free edition (https://www.logos.com/free-edition) to help you find what you need.

Read: 2 John 1-3
Discussion Questions What insight, principle, or observation from this week’s sermon did you find to be the most helpful, eye-opening, or troubling? Explain. John referred to himself as the elder, most likely referring to his status as an older man or mature believer and not to the office of elder. Name some reasons you think that is significant and what can we learn from that designation? Most of us have a bias toward being either loving or truthful. Which characterizes you? How do you become more balanced? Believers are to be united by truth, but we sometimes have different beliefs. How do we stay united within the church when we disagree? John said, “the truth will be with us forever.” Name some ways that statement encourages you or gives you hope. Next Steps Read 2 John every day this week and write down what you observe. Be prepared to discuss your observations in small group next week.

Main Idea: Remember Warnings & Stand Firm in The Face of Danger
Jude 17-23 17 But you must remember, beloved, the predictions of the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ. 18 They said to you, “In the last time there will be scoffers, following their own ungodly passions.” 19 It is these who cause divisions, worldly people, devoid of the Spirit. 20 But you, beloved, building yourselves up in your most holy faith and praying in the Holy Spirit, 21 keep yourselves in the love of God, waiting for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ that leads to eternal life.
