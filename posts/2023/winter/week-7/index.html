Anyone who is seeking eternal life must go to Jesus and simply repent of their sins and trust in Him for salvation. Jesus invites people to have life.\nRead: Matthew 19:16-30 16 And behold, a man came up to him, saying, “Teacher, what good deed must I do to have eternal life?” 17 And he said to him, “Why do you ask me about what is good? There is only one who is good. If you would enter life, keep the commandments.” 18 He said to him, “Which ones?” And Jesus said, “You shall not murder, You shall not commit adultery, You shall not steal, You shall not bear false witness, 19 Honor your father and mother, and, You shall love your neighbor as yourself.” 20 The young man said to him, “All these I have kept. What do I still lack?” 21 Jesus said to him, “If you would be perfect, go, sell what you possess and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me.” 22 When the young man heard this he went away sorrowful, for he had great possessions.\n23 And Jesus said to his disciples, “Truly, I say to you, only with difficulty will a rich person enter the kingdom of heaven. 24 Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God.” 25 When the disciples heard this, they were greatly astonished, saying, “Who then can be saved?” 26 But Jesus looked at them and said, “With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.” 27 Then Peter said in reply, “See, we have left everything and followed you. What then will we have?” 28 Jesus said to them, “Truly, I say to you, in the new world,[b] when the Son of Man will sit on his glorious throne, you who have followed me will also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel. 29 And everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or lands, for my name’s sake, will receive a hundredfold[c] and will inherit eternal life. 30 But many who are first will be last, and the last first.\nDiscussion Questions In this passage, the young man asks Jesus, “What good deed must I do to have eternal life?” How do you think this question reflects his understanding of salvation? Are we prone to believe salvation is by grace alone through faith alone in Christ alone, but live as if our works save us? Jesus responds to the young man by listing some of the commandments he must keep. How do you think this response made the young man feel? Have you ever felt like you weren’t measuring up to God’s expectations? In verse 22, the young man goes away sad because he has great wealth. What do you think this tells us about the role of money and possessions in our lives? How can we cultivate a heart that prioritizes God over material things? Jesus then tells his disciples that it is difficult for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God. Why do you think this is? How do we avoid letting our wealth or possessions become a barrier to our relationship with God? In verse 29, Jesus promises that those who give up everything for him will receive a hundred times as much and inherit eternal life. What do you think this promise means? How can we practically apply this promise to our lives today? Next Steps This week, what is one step you can take to prioritize your relationship with God over your possessions or material things.\nPrayer Focus Pray specifically that God would give you and CrossPointe a heart of generosity and a willingness to let go of earthly possessions to build up treasure in heaven. Ask God for guidance on how to use the resources God has given us to bless others and further His kingdom.\n","wordCount":"710","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-02-19T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-02-19T00:00:00Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://smallgroup.carrollmedia.dev/posts/2023/winter/week-7/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Small Group Notes","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://smallgroup.carrollmedia.dev/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><script src=/prayer.js></script><script>window.onload=init</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://smallgroup.carrollmedia.dev/ accesskey=h title="Small Group Notes (Alt + H)">Small Group Notes</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button><ul class=lang-switch><li>|</li></ul></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a class=float-right href=/reading-tracker>Reading 📚</a></li></ul></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><h1 class=post-title>How Can You Have Eternal Life?</h1><div class=post-meta>&lt;span title='2023-02-19 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>February 19, 2023&lt;/span></div></header><div class=post-content><h2 id=ice-breaker>Ice Breaker:<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#ice-breaker>#</a></h2><p>What is something that you own that you would have a hard time giving
