# Last week

## Big Idea
Any faith that does not produce works is worthless.

## Read: James 2:14-26

## Discussion Questions
1. Define clearly the issue in 2:14. Why would people claim to have genuine faith if they
don’t? What might motivate this kind of deception (or self-delusion) in our world today?
2. James attacks cold, intellectual belief in 2:19-20. Illustrate this kind of “heady” approach
to Christianity with a couple of modern examples. In what ways do you tend to
intellectualize rather than actualize your faith?

# This week
## Big Idea
The things you say, matter.

## Read: James 3:1-12
[Bible app link](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/JAS.3.ESV)

## Discussion Questions
1. Read Matthew 15:11, 17-19. According to James, what does the tongue reveal about our hearts and our minds?
2. What do our words have to do with being a mature person?
3. Why do you think James considered the tongue uncontrollable by our strength alone?

## Next Steps
How often do you think about the fact that everything you say, and think reflects your heart?
Because we think in words, we need to be especially aware of what we think, not just what we
say. This week, pay special attention to the words that you think, not just the words you say.

## Prayer Focus
October is Mission Emphasis month at CrossPointe. Pray for Elliot and Bethany Duenow, new
missionaries to Cape Town, South Africa. We will meet the Duenow family on October 22nd.
Note: Be sure to get your tickets to the Food Truck Fair this coming Sunday!


## Rabbit trail
In James 1:4, is James saying it's possible to live a sinless life? Certainly not! Here are a few brief points to support how and why the passages in James are referring to completeness and maturity regarding the Christian life and not indicating that sinless perfection is possible. 

### Language
This is perhaps the strongest "proof" that it is referring more to maturity. In the original Greek text, the word used for "perfect" in James 1:4 is "τέλειοι" (teleioi), derived from the root "τέλειος" (teleios). This term conveys the idea of completeness, maturity, or reaching a goal.

### Context
The overall narrative in James provides context for interpreting the meaning of "perfect." In James 1:2-4, the emphasis is on the process of maturing and enduring trials with joy, which ultimately leads to completeness. The word "teleioi" is used in the sense of becoming more mature in faith through the testing of one's faith. James 1:2-3 states, "Count it all joy, my brothers, when you meet trials of various kinds, for you know that the testing of your faith produces steadfastness." The focus here is on spiritual growth and development.
