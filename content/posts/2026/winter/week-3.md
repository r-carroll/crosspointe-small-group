## Scripture
[Acts 17:22-21](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/ACT.17.ESV). 



## Icebreaker Question
What is something you would find very hard to give up for 30 days—even if you knew
it would probably be good for you?

## Questions
1. According to verses 22–23, what does Paul’s interaction with the Athenians
reveal about humanity’s instinct to worship, and how does this challenge the
idea that some people are ‘non-religious’?
2. How does Paul describe God in verses 24-28? Why does this make Him
uniquely worthy of worship above all others?
3. According to verses 29–31, why does Paul insist that God alone must be
worshiped, and how does the resurrection of Jesus make this an urgent
matter?
4. Why does Paul connect repentance so closely with worship rather than just
behavior? How does the reality of resurrection and judgment shape the way
we think about who or what deserves our devotion?

## Next Steps
Identify what most shapes your time, trust, and
decisions, and consciously re-orient those
areas toward the worship of the one true God
who made you, sustains you.

## Prayer Focus
Pray that God would expose false objects of
worship in our hearts and lead us to respond
with repentance, reverence, and whole-life
devotion to Him alone.
