Faith in God’s Promise
Romans: Volume 2 - Week 3 | Week of August 18, 2024

## Big Idea
You can count on God’s promises!

## Read: 
[Romans 4:13-25](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/ROM.4.ESV)

## Discussion Questions

1. What insight, principle, or observation from this week’s sermon was the most helpful, eye-opening, or troubling? Explain.

2. What does Paul mean when he says that Abraham's promise did not come through the law but through the righteousness of faith (Romans 4:13)?  

3. How does Paul describe Abraham's faith in verses 19-21, and what can we learn from it about trusting God's promises?  

4. In verse 16, Paul says the promise is "by faith, so that it may be by grace." Why is it important that the promise comes by grace rather than by works?  

5. What is the significance of Paul's statement in verse 25 that Jesus "was delivered over to death for our sins and was raised to life for our justification"?  


## Next Steps

As we reflect on the unwavering faith of Abraham and the certainty of God's promises, let us commit to deepening our trust in God this week. Take time each day to meditate on a specific promise from Scripture and ask God to strengthen your faith in His Word. Identify one area of your life where you struggle to trust God's promise and make a deliberate choice to surrender that area to Him, trusting that His promises are sure and will be fulfilled in His perfect timing.

## Prayer Focus
This week specifically meditate and thank God for the salvation He has so graciously given to you. Pray that those who are visiting CrossPointe who have not received His grace through faith would. Pray also that God would give each of us a boldness to share the gospel with strangers, friends, and family that need to hear it.
