## Scripture
Acts 1-4

## Icebreaker Question
If you were suddenly given the boldness of a superhero, what “power” would
you use to share the gospel?

## Questions
1. What from the message stood out to you, raised a questions, or you found
impactful?

2. Read John 15:18-25 - Give some examples of this truth in the world, our
nation, and even in your own circles?

3. Those afraid of truth try their best to control what is “truth” - How do we see
this played out today? In light of this, why does proclamation of the gospel
truth bring hostility to the one proclaiming it?
4. What changed in the disciples lives to switch from self preservation just
weeks before, following the death of Jesus, to now,
“not being able not to
share” - Acts 4:19-20
5. What obstacles do you find in your own personal life in sharing the gospel.
What are some things you do, or you think you could do, to overcome them?

## Next Steps 
Work towards a plan to overcome the
challenges you find in sharing the gospel and
take an action step to becoming more bold in
sharing your faith and the gospel message
with someone.

## Prayer Focus
Pray for Boldness to proclaim the gospel no
matter how it may inconvenience you or cause
persecution. Pray also for the Cooley, Stouts,
and Solomons and the various ways they
mentioned we can be praying for them.
