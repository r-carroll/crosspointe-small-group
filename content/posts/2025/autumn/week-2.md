## Icebreaker Question
What’s one thing you’ve recommended to others recently—a restaurant, movie,
podcast, or product—that you were excited about?

## Read
[Romans 11:13-16]
The Gospel is for Everyone.

## Questions
1. In verses 13–14 Paul says he “magnifies” his ministry to the Gentiles. Why
does Paul use this language, and what does it teach us about gospel
responsibility today?
2. Paul says his goal is to “provoke” his fellow Jews to jealousy so that “some
might be saved” (v.14). How should this shape our view of evangelism?

3. In verse 15 Paul says Israel’s rejection brought reconciliation to the world, but
their acceptance will be “life from the dead.
” What does this mean, and how
does it give us hope?

4. In verse 16 Paul uses metaphors of firstfruits/dough and root/branches. How
do these images reassure us about God’s plan?

## Next Steps
This week, magnify your ministry by
intentionally sharing the gospel with
someone. Treat it not as a burden but as an
act of worship to God.


##  Prayer Focus
Pray for renewed seriousness in evangelism,
that God would use our witness to stir others
toward Christ, and that we would live with
confidence in His covenant promises that bring
“life from the dead.” Pray also for John and
Tammy Cooley, our missionaries to Jamaica.
