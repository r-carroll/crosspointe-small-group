## Scripture
[Psalm 150](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/PSA.150.ESV). 

## Questions
1. Verse 1 commands praise both “in His sanctuary” and “in His mighty
expanse.” What does this teach us about where worship happens, and how
might it challenge the tendency to limit worship to church settings?
2. Verse 2 says God must be praised for His mighty deeds and His excellent
greatness. Why does Psalm 150 connect praise both to what God has done
and to who He is?
3. Verses 3–5 call for praise with many instruments and loud celebration. What
does this reveal about the posture and intensity of biblical praise, and why
might believers today struggle with this kind of openness?
4. Verse 6 concludes, “Let everything that has breath praise the Lord.” What
does this final command teach us about who praise belongs to, and how does
it broaden our understanding of worship?

## Next Step
This week, intentionally turn one ordinary
moment each day into an act of praise —
verbally thanking God for who He is or what He
has done — and notice how this reshapes your
awareness of His presence.

## Prayer Focus
Pray that God would soften reserved hearts and
cultivate joyful, wholehearted praise. Ask Him to
help you remember His mighty works, treasure
His greatness, and respond to Him with worship
that flows from both gratitude and reverence.
