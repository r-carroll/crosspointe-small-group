## Ice Breaker
What’s a product or gadget you once thought would make life easier but ended up being more
trouble than it was worth?

## Big Idea
The struggle with sin is undeniable, but you are not without hope.

## Read: 
[Romans 7:13-25](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/ROM.7.ESV)

## Discussion Questions
1. Why does Paul emphasize that sin, not the law, is the source of death (v. 13)?
2. What does Paul mean by, “I do not do what I want, but I do the very thing I hate” (v. 15)?
3. Why does Paul say, “Nothing good dwells in me, that is, in my flesh” (v. 18)?
4. What does Paul mean by “Who will deliver me from this body of death?” (v. 24), and how
does his answer (v. 25) bring hope?
5. How does this passage prepare us for the hope and freedom described in Romans 8?

## Next Steps
Reflect on a specific struggle with sin and surrender it to God in prayer, trusting in His strength.
Memorize Romans 7:25 to remind yourself of the victory found in Christ, and encourage someone
this week by sharing how God is working in your life.

## Prayer Focus
Many are traveling to spend time with family over Thanksgiving weekend. Pray for safe travels and
opportunities for CrossPointe members to share the gospel with family.
