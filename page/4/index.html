Read: 2 John 7-13
Discussion Questions What insight, principle, or observation from this week’s sermon did you find to be the most helpful, eye-opening, or troubling? Explain. Last week you were supposed to do a personal Bible study and look up all the instances where the apostle John wrote that we are to love one another. Discuss what you found. John issued three commands in this text, the first is “watch yourselves” (v.8). How do you watch yourselves to prevent falling prey to false teachers? Why is going beyond the Word of God so dangerous? Name some of the ways this strategy has been used to lead people astray. What is significant about verse twelve? Discuss how we should apply what John said to those believers to our walk with Christ? Next Steps Next week we will begin to walk through the book of James. Please read the book of James every day this week (5 chapters will take about 15-20 minutes) and prepare for this exciting study.

Read: 2 John 4-6
Discussion Questions What insight, principle, or observation from this week’s sermon did you find to be the most helpful, eye-opening, or troubling? Explain. Last week you were supposed to read 2 John and write out what you observed from the text. Discuss what you saw in your study of this short letter. Have you ever learned a valuable lesson because you weren’t walking in truth? If you’re comfortable, share with your group what happened and what you learned. John said we are to love one another, what other “___ one another” commands are given throughout scripture? Why do you think John often repeats the command of our Lord to love one another? Next Steps Do a personal Bible study this week and look up all the instances where the apostle John wrote that we are to love one another. Use a concordance or an online Bible study tool such as Logos free edition (https://www.logos.com/free-edition) to help you find what you need.

Read: 2 John 1-3
Discussion Questions What insight, principle, or observation from this week’s sermon did you find to be the most helpful, eye-opening, or troubling? Explain. John referred to himself as the elder, most likely referring to his status as an older man or mature believer and not to the office of elder. Name some reasons you think that is significant and what can we learn from that designation? Most of us have a bias toward being either loving or truthful. Which characterizes you? How do you become more balanced? Believers are to be united by truth, but we sometimes have different beliefs. How do we stay united within the church when we disagree? John said, “the truth will be with us forever.” Name some ways that statement encourages you or gives you hope. Next Steps Read 2 John every day this week and write down what you observe. Be prepared to discuss your observations in small group next week.

Jude 17-23 17 But you must remember, beloved, the predictions of the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ. 18 They said to you, “In the last time there will be scoffers, following their own ungodly passions.” 19 It is these who cause divisions, worldly people, devoid of the Spirit. 20 But you, beloved, building yourselves up in your most holy faith and praying in the Holy Spirit, 21 keep yourselves in the love of God, waiting for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ that leads to eternal life.

Jude 5-10 Now I want to remind you, although you once fully knew it, that Jesus, who saved a people out of the land of Egypt, afterward destroyed those who did not believe. 6 And the angels who did not stay within their own position of authority, but left their proper dwelling, he has kept in eternal chains under gloomy darkness until the judgment of the great day— 7 just as Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding cities, which likewise indulged in sexual immorality and pursued unnatural desire, serve as an example by undergoing a punishment of eternal fire. 8 Yet in like manner these people also, relying on their dreams, defile the flesh, reject authority, and blaspheme the glorious ones. 9 But when the archangel Michael, contending with the devil, was disputing about the body of Moses, he did not presume to pronounce a blasphemous judgment, but said, “The Lord rebuke you.” 10 But these people blaspheme all that they do not understand, and they are destroyed by all that they, like unreasoning animals, understand instinctively.

Read Jude 1-4 (1) Jude, a servant of Jesus Christ and brother of James, To those who are called, beloved in God the Father and kept for Jesus Christ: (2) May mercy, peace, and love be multiplied to you. (3) Beloved, although I was very eager to write to you about our common salvation, I found it necessary to write appealing to you to contend for the faith that was once for all delivered to the saints. (4) For certain people have crept in unnoticed who long ago were designated for this condemnation, ungodly people, who pervert the grace of our God into sensuality and deny our only Master and Lord, Jesus Christ.

Read: Esther 5:1-14 Bible app link
Discussion Questions Describe, in your own words, God’s sovereignty and discuss why this doctrine is viewed as either troubling or comforting. How should we view God’s sovereignty, especially when difficulties come? Describe a time when you followed a plan that was determined by your will rather than God’s Word. How did this turn out for you (and others)? How did Esther display courage in this text? Discuss what the Bible teaches about courage and how this virtue should impact your life. What are some of the dangers of living for your personal joy and happiness? How can you avoid these things? In what ways can we feed idolatry in our lives rather than forsaking it? Next Steps Think about the difficulties you’ve experienced in your life and then consider how God has used those things to shape and sanctify you. Write down three lessons you’ve learned through the difficulties you’ve faced.

Read: Esther 4:1-17 Bible app link
Discussion Questions Describe a time the Lord directed you to do something, but you were full of fear rather than faith and did not obey. Why is Esther 4 a good chapter for many of us who have been in this position? How does the gospel fuel obedience to God in the life of a believer? Mordecai didn’t hide his grief but displayed it publicly for all to see. Why do we tend to conceal our grief or struggles rather than sharing them openly? What does the Bible say about being honest with each other in our struggles? We are often hopeful that somebody in the church will step up to meet a need or create an outreach ministry, why do you believe we continually hope someone else will do what we see needs to be done? Verses 15-17 uncover a substantial reversal from earlier in Esther’s story. Identify and discuss what this reversal means for Esther’s development and how it applies to you personally. Next Steps God desires to use you, not because you are perfect, not because you are highly gifted, not because you are intelligent, wealthy, well-educated, or skillful. God desires to use you because He is full of grace and mercy—it is an honor to be used by the King of Kings. This week read and meditate on 1 Corinthians 1:26-31, then journal your thoughts about how this passage applies to you.
