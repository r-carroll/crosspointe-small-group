## Scripture
[Psalm 96](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/PSA.96.ESV)

## Icebreaker Question
If someone watched your life for a week—with no explanation from you—what would
they conclude you value most?

## Questions
1. What stands out to you about how Psalm 96 speaks about worship, and how
does this psalm challenge the common idea that worship is optional or
preference-driven?
2. According to verses 4-6, why is the Lord worthy of worship regardless of
circumstances, and how does this confront the idea that worship depends on
how life is going?
3. Verses 7–9 call God’s people to “ascribe” glory and to worship with
reverence. What does it mean to ascribe glory to God, and where are we
tempted to offer Him casual or distracted worship instead?
4. Verses 10–13 celebrate the Lord as King and Judge. Why does Psalm 96 treat
God’s judgment as good news, and how should this truth shape both our
worship and our witness?

## Next Steps
This week, intentionally reorder one part of
your schedule or routine to reflect that
worship is not optional.

## Prayer Focus
Pray that God would enlarge our view of who
He is—His greatness, glory, and justice—and
expose any ways we have treated worship as
optional or secondary.
