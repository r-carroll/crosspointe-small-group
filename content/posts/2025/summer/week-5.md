## Read
[Romans 9:14-18](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/ROM.9.ESV)

## Qestions 
1. How does Paul respond to the objection in verse 14: “Is there injustice on
God’s part?” Why might people feel this doctrine makes God seem unfair?
2. In verse 16, Paul says salvation depends “not on human will or exertion, but
on God, who has mercy.
” What does this teach about the nature of saving
grace?

3. What is Paul teaching in verse 17 by quoting God’s words to Pharaoh? Why
would God raise someone up only to demonstrate His power?
4. Verse 18 concludes: “So then he has mercy on whomever he wills, and he
hardens whomever he wills.” How should we respond to a God who acts this
way?

## Next steps
This week, meditate on Romans 9:16 and
write out a prayer thanking God for His
mercy. Consider how often you've tried to
“run” your way into favor with God—and
rejoice that salvation depends on His
mercy, not your merit.

## Prayer Focus
_Praise_ God for His sovereign mercy—that
salvation is by grace and not by works.

_Confess_ any frustration or pride in wanting
God to operate according to our standards.
Thank God for saving us when we didn’t
deserve it.

_Ask_ for a deeper trust in God’s wisdom and a
heart that finds joy in His will.

_Intercede_ for unbelieving friends or family,
asking God to grant them mercy and soften
their hearts.
