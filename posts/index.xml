Discussion Questions What did Abraham and his legacy mean to the Jewish people and what was Paul&amp;rsquo;s purpose of bringing him up in this passage? How did Abraham exhibit faith in Genesis 15:4-11? What does Abraham&amp;rsquo;s sinfulness reveal to us? In verses 5 and 6, what does the phrase &amp;ldquo;God counts/imputes righteousness&amp;rdquo; mean? What are the conditions if any of God imputing his righteousness?

Discussion Questions In what ways do you see self-righteousness manifest in your life? How do you battle your self-righteous tendencies? Why is it important to recognize that faith itself is not what saves us but rather the work of Jesus Christ? How does Romans 3:29-30 emphasize the unity of Jews and Gentiles in terms of faith?

Small Group Discussion This week concluded this mini-series, which was an extension of the original “Serve the Lord” series from January of this year. What will you stick with you from these messages on Christian service? What does Paul mean when he says that the Gentiles walk in the “futility of their minds” (vs. 17)? Why are their minds this way? In verse 19, Paul notes that the Gentiles “have become callous,” giving themselves up to sin.</description></item><item><title>Serve: Engage Your Mind</title><link>https://smallgroup.carrollmedia.dev/posts/2024/summer/week-3/</link><pubDate>Sun, 14 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://smallgroup.carrollmedia.dev/posts/2024/summer/week-3/</guid><description>Scripture: Psalm 32
Small Group Discussion What stood out to you from the sermon this week? This week’s message focused on a psalm. Is there a psalm you have found to be particularly meaningful in your walk with the Lord? Many people today fail to acknowledge with their minds what is true. What are some examples of this?

Small Group Discussion What stood out to you in this week’s message? What was good, helpful, convicting, troubling, or led to more questions for you? Why is it so important for each believer to know the Word? Why do you think it is hard for many professing believers to be faithfully involved in a church or place themselves in a position to hear the Word taught? From the message what was the difference between Apostles and Prophets and Evangelists, Shepherds and Teachers?</description></item><item><title>Serve the Lord: Equipped with the Word</title><link>https://smallgroup.carrollmedia.dev/posts/2024/summer/week-1/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://smallgroup.carrollmedia.dev/posts/2024/summer/week-1/</guid><description>Called through the Word to the Word Scripture: Ephesians 4:1-16
Questions What stood out to you in this week’s message? What was good, helpful, convicting, troubling, or led to more questions for you? Why is the Word of God so important?

Read: Romans 2:1-4
Discussion Questions How does Romans 2:1-4 address the issue of self-righteous judgment? What role does God&amp;rsquo;s kindness play in His judgment according to Romans 2:4? How does Paul address moralists in Romans 2:1-3, and what broader message does he convey about sin and judgment through this approach? What warning does the sermon give about presuming upon God&amp;rsquo;s mercy, and what should be our correct response to God&amp;rsquo;s patience and kindness?</description></item><item><title>When God gives up</title><link>https://smallgroup.carrollmedia.dev/posts/2024/spring/week-7/</link><pubDate>Sun, 19 May 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://smallgroup.carrollmedia.dev/posts/2024/spring/week-7/</guid><description>Big Idea Those who oppose God invite destruction.
Read: Romans 1:19-32
Discussion Questions Romans 1:24-25 explains that God turns people over to their selfish desires due to their rejection of Him. How do these selfish desires manifest in today&amp;rsquo;s society, and what are some examples of how they lead to personal and societal destruction? In Romans 1:26-27, Paul describes God turning people over to unnatural activities due to their opposition to Him.</description></item><item><title>The Wrath of God pt. 2</title><link>https://smallgroup.carrollmedia.dev/posts/2024/spring/week-6/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 May 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://smallgroup.carrollmedia.dev/posts/2024/spring/week-6/</guid><description>Big Idea God’s wrath cannot be ignored.
Read: Romans 1:18
Discussion Questions Reflecting on the concept of God&amp;rsquo;s holiness, why do you think it&amp;rsquo;s challenging for humans to fully grasp the idea that God is both transcendent and morally pure? How does this understanding impact our view of sin and our relationship with God? Ungodliness leads to unrighteousness. How do you see this progression playing out in your own life or in the world around you?</description></item><item><title>The Wrath of God</title><link>https://smallgroup.carrollmedia.dev/posts/2024/spring/week-5/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 May 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://smallgroup.carrollmedia.dev/posts/2024/spring/week-5/</guid><description>Big Idea God’s wrath cannot be ignored.
Read: Romans 1:18
Discussion Questions In what ways do we see God&amp;rsquo;s wrath being revealed in the world today, and how does this align with the depiction of God’s wrath in Romans 1:18? Romans 1:18 states that God’s wrath comes from heaven against all godlessness and wickedness of people who suppress the truth. How can we understand and explain the justification of God&amp;rsquo;s wrath in a contemporary context where the idea of divine wrath might be challenging or misunderstood?</description></item><item><title>Not Ashamed</title><link>https://smallgroup.carrollmedia.dev/posts/2024/spring/week-4/</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://smallgroup.carrollmedia.dev/posts/2024/spring/week-4/</guid><description>Big Idea Everyone needs to hear the gospel.
Read Romans 1:16-17
Discussion Questions How does Paul describe the power of the gospel in Romans 1:16, and what implications does this have for how we view and share the gospel with others? Paul emphasizes that the gospel is for &amp;ldquo;everyone who believes&amp;rdquo; (Romans 1:16). How does this universal call to belief challenge or reinforce our understanding of who needs salvation and who can receive it?</description></item><item><title>Compelled by Care</title><link>https://smallgroup.carrollmedia.dev/posts/2024/spring/week-3/</link><pubDate>Sun, 14 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://smallgroup.carrollmedia.dev/posts/2024/spring/week-3/</guid><description>Big Idea Genuine care leads to action.
Read Romans 1:8-15
Discussion Questions What stood out to you? In verse 8, Paul expresses gratitude for the faith of the Roman Christians. How does expressing gratitude for the faith of others contribute to building a strong Christian community? In verse 10, Paul mentions his desire to visit the Roman Christians. What do you think motivated Paul&amp;rsquo;s desire to do so? How does face-to-face interaction impact our relationships with fellow believers and our ability to support and encourage one another?</description></item><item><title>Getting the Gospel Right</title><link>https://smallgroup.carrollmedia.dev/posts/2024/spring/week-2/</link><pubDate>Sun, 14 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://smallgroup.carrollmedia.dev/posts/2024/spring/week-2/</guid><description>Big Idea The gospel is the good news that must be heard and understood.
Read: Romans 1:1-7
Discussion Questions What insight, principle, or observation from this week’s sermon was helpful, eye-opening, or troubling? Explain. In verses 3-4, Paul describes God’s Son in two ways. How do those two ways relate to the Old Testament, and why is this important? The purpose of bringing about “the obedience of faith” is for “the sake of His name among all nations” (1:5).</description></item><item><title>Romans #1: The Gospel of God</title><link>https://smallgroup.carrollmedia.dev/posts/2024/spring/week-1/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://smallgroup.carrollmedia.dev/posts/2024/spring/week-1/</guid><description>Big Idea God’s purpose and plan are inevitable.
Read: Romans 1:1
Discussion Questions What insight, principle, or observation from this week’s sermon was helpful, eye-opening, or troubling? Explain. Paul called himself a slave, an apostle, and one who was set apart for the gospel of God. Which of these descriptions resonates most with you? Explain your answer. Why don’t genuine apostles still exist? Read 1:1-7 and 16:25-27.

Text: Judges 2:1-15
Discussion Questions What stood out to you, made you think, or was something that you liked, or remember from the sermon? Or What are you excited about, if anything, in studying the book of Judges? How did the Israelites disregard God?

Money should not control our hearts and lives but rather God should. Money then is a temporary gift that God gives us to serve him to the absolute fullest measure we can in this life. We should steward our resources and money and use them to serve others, the church, and the mission of the church is to further the kingdom of God.</description></item><item><title>Guard the Good Deposit</title><link>https://smallgroup.carrollmedia.dev/posts/2024/winter/week-5/</link><pubDate>Sun, 11 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://smallgroup.carrollmedia.dev/posts/2024/winter/week-5/</guid><description>Read 2 Tim 1:8-14
Questions Who has God used to pass the good deposit on to you? How have they invested in you? Read Paul’s “trustworthy sayings”: 1 Timothy 1:15, 3:1, 4:8-9; 2 Timothy 2:11-13. What does his emphasis on sayings like these tell us about what it means to follow God? In 1 Timothy 4:16, Paul tells Timothy, “Keep a close watch on yourself and on the teaching.” Read this in context (start in verse 6).</description></item><item><title>Take Care How You Build &amp; Life of a Steward</title><link>https://smallgroup.carrollmedia.dev/posts/2024/winter/week-4/</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://smallgroup.carrollmedia.dev/posts/2024/winter/week-4/</guid><description>Take Care How You Build Read: 1 Corinthians 3:10-15

Discussion Questions What insight, principle, or observation from this week’s sermon did you find to be the most helpful, eye-opening, or troubling? Explain. James wanted his readers to understand that selfishness—which is a result of adopting worldly wisdom—will always destroy peace. Name some ways this is true in different aspects of life. One of the issues that James addresses in this text is that we are prone to covet or envy.</description></item><item><title>The Good Life</title><link>https://smallgroup.carrollmedia.dev/posts/2023/autumn/week-3/</link><pubDate>Sun, 22 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://smallgroup.carrollmedia.dev/posts/2023/autumn/week-3/</guid><description>Big Idea The wisdom that guides your life cannot be hidden.

Read: James 2:14-26 Bible app link
Discussion Questions Define clearly the issue in 2:14. Why would people claim to have genuine faith if they don’t? What might motivate this kind of deception (or self-delusion) in our world today? James attacks cold, intellectual belief in 2:19-20.

James 2:1-13 My brothers, show no partiality as you hold the faith in our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory. 2 For if a man wearing a gold ring and fine clothing comes into your assembly, and a poor man in shabby clothing also comes in, 3 and if you pay attention to the one who wears the fine clothing and say, “You sit here in a good place,” while you say to the poor man, “You stand over there,” or, “Sit down at my feet,” 4 have you not then made distinctions among yourselves and become judges with evil thoughts?</description></item><item><title>Beware!</title><link>https://smallgroup.carrollmedia.dev/posts/2023/summer/week-8/</link><pubDate>Sun, 20 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://smallgroup.carrollmedia.dev/posts/2023/summer/week-8/</guid><description>Big Idea Beware of those who lie about Jesus.

Jude 5-10 Now I want to remind you, although you once fully knew it, that Jesus, who saved a people out of the land of Egypt, afterward destroyed those who did not believe. 6 And the angels who did not stay within their own position of authority, but left their proper dwelling, he has kept in eternal chains under gloomy darkness until the judgment of the great day— 7 just as Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding cities, which likewise indulged in sexual immorality and pursued unnatural desire, serve as an example by undergoing a punishment of eternal fire.</description></item><item><title>Jude Week 1</title><link>https://smallgroup.carrollmedia.dev/posts/2023/summer/week-1/</link><pubDate>Sun, 02 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://smallgroup.carrollmedia.dev/posts/2023/summer/week-1/</guid><description>Main Idea: As children of God, it is necessary to be alert and ready to stand on truth and proclaim the truth in the midst of opposition and persecution.
Read Jude 1-4 (1) Jude, a servant of Jesus Christ and brother of James, To those who are called, beloved in God the Father and kept for Jesus Christ: (2) May mercy, peace, and love be multiplied to you. (3) Beloved, although I was very eager to write to you about our common salvation, I found it necessary to write appealing to you to contend for the faith that was once for all delivered to the saints.</description></item><item><title>When God Brings Difficulties</title><link>https://smallgroup.carrollmedia.dev/posts/2023/spring/week-8/</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 May 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://smallgroup.carrollmedia.dev/posts/2023/spring/week-8/</guid><description>Big Idea God often allows difficulties to expose the orientation of your heart.
