## Next Steps

## Prayer Focus
● If you’re already dicipleing others in the faith, ask God for continued wisdom so that your efforts will be even more effective.
● If you can’t think of anyone you’re mentoring, pray that God would show you people in your sphere of influence who would benefit from this. And pray that He would lead you as you begin to lead these individuals.
