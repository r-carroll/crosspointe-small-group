Many Christians struggle with prayer. Is praying a struggle for you? If so, why do you believe you struggle. If not, how did you grow in this discipline? Read verse two. Why are David’s words significant and what can we learn from this verse about seeking the Lord in prayer? Twice in this prayer David acknowledged wicked people. What do verses 4-6 and 9-10 teach us about sin and a sinner’s position with God? Prayer should bring about rejoicing in your life. Look over the entire Psalm once again and identify some reasons to rejoice in God. Next Steps This week, record how much time you spend seeking the Lord through prayer. Based on what you find, can you say that prayer is a priority in your life?\nPrayer Focus Continue to pray for Jenna, Kenley, Cohen, and Ivy Beer as they mourn. Pray for God to comfort them and provide peace to their souls.\n","wordCount":"447","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-01-22T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-01-22T00:00:00Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://smallgroup.carrollmedia.dev/posts/2023/winter/week-3/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Small Group Notes","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://smallgroup.carrollmedia.dev/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://smallgroup.carrollmedia.dev/ accesskey=h title="Small Group Notes (Alt + H)">Small Group Notes</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><h1 class=post-title>A Spiritual Transaction with the Creator of Heaven and Earth</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-01-22 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>January 22, 2023</span></div></header><div class=post-content><h2 id=big-idea>Big Idea<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#big-idea>#</a></h2><p>God is available and ready to hear His people who seek Him through prayer.</p><h2 id=read-psalm-51-12>Read: Psalm 5:1-12<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#read-psalm-51-12>#</a></h2><p>To the choirmaster: for the flutes.

5 Give ear to my words, O Lord;
consider my groaning.

my King and my God,

3 O Lord, in the morning you hear my voice;
