## Scripture
[Ruth 1:1-22](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/RUT.1.ESV)

## Icebreaker Question
If you had to be the spokesperson for any product—serious or silly—what would you
choose?

## Questions
1. What stands out to you about the opening verses of Ruth (1:1–5), and how do
they challenge our assumptions about the “normal” Christian life?
2. Naomi’s bitterness is raw and honest (1:20–21). In what ways does bitterness
still cloud our ability to see God’s grace today?
3. What does Ruth’s commitment to Naomi (1:16–17) reveal about how God
often works through ordinary, loyal, unseen obedience?
4. How does the final verse (1:22) reframe the entire chapter, and where do you
need to reclaim hope in the middle of your own difficulty?

## Next Steps
Identify one area of life where circumstances
have discouraged you. Commit this week to
intentionally look for evidences of God’s
grace in that area—write them down daily so
you can begin to see what bitterness often
hides.

## Prayer Focus
Pray that God would open our eyes to His
providence even in painful seasons, protect us
from bitterness, and teach us to trust that He is
always working for His glory and our good.
