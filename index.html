Questions Read Psalm 73:1-5. Can you relate to the psalmist? Do you envy prosperity of those who don‚Äôt follow God? How does the psalmist in Psalm 73 resolve his envy? How does this relate to the final section of Malachi? Who or what is the ‚Äúsun of righteousness‚Äù in Malachi 4:2? What strikes you about this imagery? Read Mal 4:2. Why are the righteous portrayed as leaping like ‚Äúcalves from the stall‚Äù? Next Steps Pray for the lost, who will not rejoice when the sun of righteousness returns. Think of individual people you know who seem not to fear the Lord. Pray that God would use you to point them to Him. Thank God that the sun of righteousness brings healing in his wings, that he rescues us from our sin</p></div><footer class=entry-footer><span title='2025-02-23 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>February 23, 2025</span></footer><a class=entry-link aria-label="post link to A Tale of Two Humanities" href=https://smallgroup.carrollmedia.dev/posts/2025/winter/week-8/></a></article><article class=post-entry><header class=entry-header><h2 class=entry-hint-parent>The God and the Faithless</h2></header><div class=entry-content><p>Read: Malachi 2:17 ‚Äì 3:12
Small Group Discussion In 2:17, we read that God is wearied by the people‚Äôs words. What does this reveal to us about God? What are ways that we, too, may weary Him with what we say or do? In 3:3, we read of Messiah purifying the sons of Levi‚Äîthat is, the priests. However, in the New Testament we read that all believers are part of the priesthood (1 Pet 2:4-5, 9-10). We, too, should therefore expect to be purified‚Äîhave our sins removed. This will be completed when Christ returns, but God is also purifying us now. How have you experienced this in your life? Is it painless? How can we cultivate gratefulness for this process? Read Mal 3:6. Why is it good news that God does not change? Why was it such a big deal that the people were cutting corners on their tithe? See 3:10-12. Next Steps Repent of faithless words, actions. Thank God that we have abundant reasons to trust Him. Commit to speaking truthfully about God and giving generously to show you trust Him</p></div><footer class=entry-footer><span title='2025-02-16 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>February 16, 2025</span></footer><a class=entry-link aria-label="post link to The God and the Faithless" href=https://smallgroup.carrollmedia.dev/posts/2025/winter/week-7/></a></article><article class=post-entry><header class=entry-header><h2 class=entry-hint-parent>Faithfulness in Leadership and Marriage</h2></header><div class=entry-content><p>Big Idea: Faithfulness to God is reflected in our worship, leadership, and relationships‚Äîespecially in marriage.

Icebreaker: What‚Äôs the best piece of advice you‚Äôve ever been given about relationships, marriage, or commitment? Or, What‚Äôs the worst piece of relationship advice you‚Äôve ever heard?
Questions Read Malachi 2:1-2. Why is God so serious about honoring His name? Read Malachi 2:5-6. What qualities made Levi a godly leader? Read Malachi 2:8. How can spiritual leaders cause others to stumble? Read Malachi 2:10-11. What does faithfulness to God have to do with how we treat others? Read Malachi 2:14. Why does God call marriage a covenant? Read Malachi 2:15-16. What does it mean to ‚Äúguard yourselves in your spirit‚Äù? Prayer Focus For our worship ‚Äì That we would honor God with our actions, not just words.

Questions How have you personally experienced God‚Äôs love, even when you didn‚Äôt deserve it? Next Step: Spend time this week thanking God for specific ways He has shown His love to you. What are some ways people (including ourselves) offer God ‚Äúhalf-hearted sacrifices‚Äù today? Next Step: Identify one area of your life where you have been offering God less than your best and commit to change this week. Why do you think God desires our sincere devotion rather than empty rituals? Next Step: Be intentional this week about worshiping God with sincerity. Before praying, singing, or serving, take a moment to align your heart with God. In what ways do we sometimes treat worship as a burden rather than a joy? Next Step: Reflect on your attitude toward worship and find one way to make it a joy this week (e.g., prepare ahead for Sunday, listen to worship music, or serve in a new way). What would change in your life if you truly viewed your time, talents, and treasures as offerings to God? Next Step: Make a specific plan to use your time, talents, or treasures in a way that honors God this week. How can we, as a church, encourage one another toward wholehearted worship? Next Step: Reach out to one person in your church this week to encourage them in their walk with God. Prayer Focus: Individually: Pray for God to reveal areas where you need to give Him your best, and ask for a heart of joyful worship. Corporately: Pray that our church would not offer God half-hearted worship but would be a people who honor Him with sincerity and passion. Next Steps Reach out to one person in your church this week to encourage them in their walk with God.

Big Idea You must trust God even when you don‚Äôt want to trust Him.
Read: Deuteronomy 1:19-21, 26
Discussion Questions Read 1:26-27: How does fear distort our view of God‚Äôs character, and why is this so dangerous? Read 1:28-33: Why is it easier to focus on obstacles than on God‚Äôs power? What does this reveal about our faith? Read 1:34-35, 40: How does disobedience show a lack of trust in God, and what are the consequences of disobedience in our lives? Read 1:42-44: Why is presumption (acting without God) so dangerous, and how is it different from genuine faith? Read: 1:30; John 14:1: How does this passage ultimately point us to Christ, and why is He the answer to our failure to trust God? Next Steps Identify one tangible way you can demonstrate trust in God this week by stepping outside your comfort zone. Maybe it‚Äôs having a difficult conversation, saying yes to something He‚Äôs calling you to, or surrendering control in a specific area of your life. Write it down as a commitment and ask someone in the group to pray for you as you take this step. At the end of the week, reflect on how taking action grew your faith and prepared you to trust Him more in the future.

Read: 2 Kings 18:1-6
Discussion Questions What does it mean to trust in God‚Äôs character, and how does knowing Him deepen that trust? How do you respond with your faith is challenged by doubt, fear, or opposition? What can we learn from Hezekiah‚Äôs prayer in 2 Kings 19:14-19 about how to approach God in times of crisis? How does God‚Äôs deliverance in 2 Kings 19:32-37 demonstrate His sovereignty and power? How can this strengthen your faith? What are some practical ways you can demonstrate trust in God daily, especially in difficult situations? Next Steps Identify one practical way to trust God in a current situation and share it with someone who can pray for you and hold you accountable.

Read: Proverbs 3:5-6
Discussion Questions What does it mean to trust in the Lord with all your heart? Why do you think God requires complete trust? Why do you think we often rely on our own understanding instead of trusting God? Can you share a time when this happened to you or someone you know? What does ‚Äúacknowledge Him in all your ways‚Äù look like in everyday life? Why do you think there are areas of your life where it‚Äôs harder to involve Him? How does the truth that God will make your paths straight encourage you in uncertain times? What do you find most challenging about living out trust and surrender in the Christian life? Next Steps Take time this week to list specific promises of God that remind you why He is trustworthy.

Read together Luke 22:39-46. Then read again verse 42. How are Christ‚Äôs words in this verse a pattern for believers? Read together Psalm 130. Then read again verses three and four. How does God‚Äôs forgiveness enable Christians to have the right kind of fear of Him? Prayer Focus Pray for babies at risk of dying by abortion, that God would spare them.

Big Idea The struggle with sin is undeniable, but you are not without hope.
Read: Romans 7:13-25
Discussion Questions Why does Paul emphasize that sin, not the law, is the source of death (v. 13)? What does Paul mean by, ‚ÄúI do not do what I want, but I do the very thing I hate‚Äù (v. 15)? Why does Paul say, ‚ÄúNothing good dwells in me, that is, in my flesh‚Äù (v. 18)? What does Paul mean by ‚ÄúWho will deliver me from this body of death?‚Äù (v. 24), and how does his answer (v. 25) bring hope? How does this passage prepare us for the hope and freedom described in Romans 8? Next Steps Reflect on a specific struggle with sin and surrender it to God in prayer, trusting in His strength. Memorize Romans 7:25 to remind yourself of the victory found in Christ, and encourage someone this week by sharing how God is working in your life.

Big Idea God‚Äôs law is good.
Read: Romans 7:7-12
Discussion Questions How does Paul‚Äôs statement, ‚ÄúI would not have known what sin was except through the law‚Äù (Romans 7:7), challenge our understanding of sin before we encounter God‚Äôs Word? Read Romans 7:8. Why do you think sin takes advantage of the law to provoke more sin? Read Romans 7:9, What does Paul mean by ‚ÄúI died‚Äù in this context? How does Paul‚Äôs statement that ‚Äúsin, seizing the opportunity through the commandment, deceived me, and through the commandment killed me‚Äù (Romans 7:11) shed light on the deceptive power of sin? In Romans 7:12, Paul says, ‚ÄúSo then, the law is holy, and the commandment is holy, righteous, and good.‚Äù How can we reconcile the fact that the law reveals sin but is still described as ‚Äúholy, righteous, and good‚Äù? Next Steps Recognize that the law, though good, exposes the depth of your sin. Spend time reflecting on how God‚Äôs commands have revealed areas where you have fallen short, whether in thoughts, attitudes, or actions. Repent of these areas, acknowledging your need for God‚Äôs forgiveness and grace.
