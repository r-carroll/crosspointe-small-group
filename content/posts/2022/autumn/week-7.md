## Big Idea
Right teaching leads to right living which displays the truth and beauty of the gospel.


## Read: Titus 2:1-10
But as for you, teach what accords with sound doctrine. 2Older men are to be sober-minded, dignified, self-controlled, sound in faith, in love, and in steadfastness. 3Older women likewise are to be reverent in behavior, not slanderers or slaves to much wine. They are to teach what is good, 4and so train the young women to love their husbands and children, 5to be self-controlled, pure, working at home, kind, and submissive to their own husbands, that the word of God may not be reviled. 6Likewise, urge the younger men to be self-controlled. 7Show yourself in all respects to be a model of good works, and in your teaching show integrity, dignity, 8and sound speech that cannot be condemned, so that an opponent may be put to shame, having nothing evil to say about us. 9Bondservants are to be submissive to their own masters in everything; they are to be well-pleasing, not argumentative, 10not pilfering, but showing all good faith, so that in everything they may adorn the doctrine of God our Savior.

## Discussion Questions
1. What was the most impactful thing from the text and the sermon this week?
2. Being self-controlled is listed three times in this text (vs. 2, 5, 6). What does it
mean to be self-controlled and, in your own words, describe why this is important
for older and younger believers.
3. After reading the text together, discuss the significance of mentoring in the local
church.
4. Paul understood that those who are outside the church are watching those who
are inside the church (vs. 5, 8, 10). Why do you believe people are watching
and what is the proper response to this reality?
>Think of an instance where someone you know behaved in such a way that affected a non-believer


## Next Steps
If you are not being mentored or mentoring someone, use a journal and write down
some of the benefits you believe would come from a mentoring relationship. If you are
being mentored or are mentoring someone, use a journal and write down some of the
things youâ€™ve learned through that relationship.
## Prayer Focus
We all have character deficiencies. This week, use your prayer time to ask God to
reveal your weaknesses and ask the Holy Spirit for continued enablement to apply the
gospel daily.
