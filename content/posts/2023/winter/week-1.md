## Big Idea
Seek the Lord instead of seeking after things, like those who have no hope.

## Read: Matthew 6:25-34
“Therefore I tell you, do not be anxious about your life, what you will eat or what you will drink, nor about your body, what you will put on. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothing? “Therefore do not be anxious about tomorrow, for tomorrow will be anxious for itself. Sufficient for the day is its own trouble. Look at the birds of the air: they neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not of more value than they? And which of you by being anxious can add a single hour to his span of life? And why are you anxious about clothing? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow: they neither toil nor spin, yet I tell you, even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these. But if God so clothes the grass of the field, which today is alive and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, will he not much more clothe you, O you of little faith? Therefore do not be anxious, saying, ‘What shall we eat?’ or ‘What shall we drink?’ or ‘What shall we wear?’ For the Gentiles seek after all these things, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them all. But seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be added to you.


## Discussion Questions
1. What was the most impactful thing from the text and the sermon this week?
2. Jesus issued three commands in this text instructing His disciples to not be
anxious (v.25), look (v.26) and seek (v.33). What do these commands teach us
about how we are to live?
3. How does seeking the Lord make us distinct from unbelievers?
4. What are some things that you often seek in place of the Lord?
5. Considering our discussion, what name some things you are grateful for.

## Next Steps
Take some time this week and write down the things you find yourself worrying about.
How often do you worry instead of seeking the Lord?
## Prayer Focus
Pray that each member of your small group will have a greater desire to seek the Lord
and live this year and ask God to show you how you can encourage them in the
process.
