## Big Idea
The gospel is the good news that must be heard and understood.

## Read: 
[Romans 1:1-7](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/ROM.1.ESV)

## Discussion Questions
1. What insight, principle, or observation from this week’s sermon was helpful, eye-opening,
or troubling? Explain.
2. In verses 3-4, Paul describes God’s Son in two ways. How do those two ways relate to the
Old Testament, and why is this important?
3. The purpose of bringing about “the obedience of faith” is for “the sake of His name among
all nations” (1:5). How do you fit into this grand plan?
4. Name how this opening passage in Romans gives you confidence as a believer. Please
explain your answer.

## Next Steps
How much time do you spend reading and studying the Old Testament? As you consider Paul’s
greeting to the believers in Rome, consider its value and the impact that section of God’s Word
has made on your life.

## Prayer Focus
John and Tammy Cooley, our missionaries to Jamaica, will be with us next week. Please pray for the
Cooleys as they travel and pray that they will enjoy some much-needed downtime with their
families.
