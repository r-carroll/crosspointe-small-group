## Scripture:
[Ephesians 4:1-16]

## Small Group Discussion
1. What stood out to you in this week’s message? What was good, helpful, convicting, troubling,
or led to more questions for you?
2. Why is it so important for each believer to know the Word?
3. Why do you think it is hard for many professing believers to be faithfully involved in a church
or place themselves in a position to hear the Word taught?
4. From the message what was the difference between Apostles and Prophets and Evangelists,
Shepherds and Teachers?
5. We are called to grow in our faith and knowledge so that we are not carried away by every
wind of doctrine, by human cunning, by craftiness in deceitful schemes. Describe some of the
false doctrines, human cunning, craftiness, and deceitful schemes you see in the world and
even churches today.

## Next Steps:
Invite and encourage others at CrossPointe who don’t already attend an Adult
Bible Education class to attend one with you or to come to Wednesday night Bible Study.

## Prayer Focus:
Pray that God would help the members of CrossPointe Church to see the
importance of working and growing together in the Word and that we would be faithful to one
another and faithfully proclaim the Word to one another.
