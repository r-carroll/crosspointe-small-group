## Big Idea
A follower of Christ will put Christ and his commandments above everyone including
self.

## Read

“Do not think that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I have not come to bring peace, but a
sword. For I have come to set a man against his father, and a daughter against her mother, and
a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law. And a person’s enemies will be those of his own
household. Whoever loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me, and whoever
loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me. And whoever does not take his cross
and follow me is not worthy of me. Whoever finds his life will lose it, and whoever loses his life
for my sake will find it. (ESV)

## Discussion Questions:
1. Take a moment to research and read Bible verses that talk about the peace Jesus
brings.
    1.  What do these verses mean to a follower of Christ and a non-follower?
    2. Why did Jesus say He didn’t come to bring peace?
2. Do you know of anyone who had to give up a relationship with a family member in order
to follow the commands of Christ?
3. How has following Jesus changed the way you think and live?
4. Read 2 Corinthians 6:14-18 - What do these verses mean?
    Why is their such a strong divide between believers and non-believers
5. What other passages come to mind when thinking about the ultimatum Jesus
gives of All In or All Out?

## Next Steps: 
Take time this week to really consider - Am I All In? What areas in my life would
say differently? Examine if there are areas in your life where you have usurped your own ideas
of what it means to be a follower of Christ vs Christ’s all or nothing presentation of the gospel.

## Prayer Focus:
For our church to be united in following Christ boldly and without fear.
