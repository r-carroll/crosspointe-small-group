# What Is Precious to Jesus?

## Big Idea
The Church is Precious to Jesus!

## Read: 
Ephesians 5:22-32

## Discussion Questions
1. What was the most impactful thing from the text and the sermon this week?
2. The church is called to submit to Christ, name some ways we struggle to submit
and discuss how we can better follow the headship of our Savior.
3. Separation and sanctification are presented together in verses 26-27. Talk about
why these two things are necessary in the life of every believer.
4. Read verses 28-30 and explain how the text provides comfort, hope, and
encouragement. How do these verses challenge you?
5. Marriage has always been a picture of Jesus’ union with His church. How
should this truth impact your marriage or future marriage? Name specific
reasons we fail to follow God’s instruction for marriage?
> Bonus question: How has the fall affected the roles in marriage the God laid out? Read d Genesis 3:16-17.
