Read 2 Peter 2, 1 Cor. 12:1-10, Heb. 3:16- 19 Think of a time when you went rogue? Meaning you went outside your position given to you by some authority (boss, teacher, parent, spouse), and did what you wanted, not what was assigned or commanded or given for you to do. Did you get caught? God, knowing everything, knows when you rebel against clear commandments given in the Word of God. Discuss why God hates rebellion against his Word. How do you identify a spiritual counterfeit? Especially if those who are apostates know and understand certain truths about the Bible. Hint: Think back to the points of Ben’s sermon\nWhere do we draw the line when it comes to witchcraft and demonology? Should we be engaging our mind with something that God has clearly called sin? Do we revere even the demons enough to know that they have more power than what we may think or know? Are you actively contending for the faith? How? What does it look like for you? Prayer Focus: Spend time this week praying through God’s grace, be thankful, that if you are a true believer in Christ you are no longer under judgment but under the grace of God. Pray God opens your eyes to the character and lifestyle of spiritual counterfeits.\nNext Steps: Read through Numbers 14, Genesis 6, and Genesis 19 ask yourself how often you actually think about the judgment of the ungodly. Make it appoint this week to thank God for mercy.\n","wordCount":"493","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-07-09T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-07-09T00:00:00Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://smallgroup.carrollmedia.dev/posts/2023/summer/week-2/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Small Group Notes","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://smallgroup.carrollmedia.dev/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><script src=/prayer.js></script><script>window.onload=init</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://smallgroup.carrollmedia.dev/ accesskey=h title="Small Group Notes (Alt + H)">Small Group Notes</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button><ul class=lang-switch><li>|</li></ul></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a class=float-right href=/prayer-tracker>Prayer &#128591;</a></li></ul></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><h1 class=post-title>The Judgment and Character of Spiritual Counterfeits</h1><div class=post-meta>&lt;span title='2023-07-09 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>July 9, 2023&lt;/span></div></header><div class=post-content><h2 id=big-idea>Big Idea:<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#big-idea>#</a></h2><p>Believers in Christ need to remember the judgment of God on apostates, and be able to
