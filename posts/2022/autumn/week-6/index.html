Big Idea A well-ordered church is led by elders who teach and protect God’s people.\nRead: Titus 1:5-16 This is why I left you in Crete, so that you might put what remained into order, and appoint elders in every town as I directed you— 6if anyone is above reproach, the husband of one wife, and his children are believers and not open to the charge of debauchery or insubordination. 7For an overseer, as God’s steward, must be above reproach. He must not be arrogant or quick-tempered or a drunkard or violent or greedy for gain, 8but hospitable, a lover of good, self-controlled, upright, holy, and disciplined. 9He must hold firm to the trustworthy word as taught, so that he may be able to give instruction in sound doctrine and also to rebuke those who contradict it. 10For there are many who are insubordinate, empty talkers and deceivers, especially those of the circumcision party. 11They must be silenced, since they are upsetting whole families by teaching for shameful gain what they ought not to teach. 12One of the Cretans, a prophet of their own, said, “Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, lazy gluttons.” 13This testimony is true. Therefore rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith, 14not devoting themselves to Jewish myths and the commands of people who turn away from the truth. 15To the pure, all things are pure, but to the defiled and unbelieving, nothing is pure; but both their minds and their consciences are defiled. 16They profess to know God, but they deny him by their works. They are detestable, disobedient, unfit for any good work.\nDiscussion Questions What was the most impactful thing from the text and the sermon this week? In verses 6-9a, Paul gave the character qualities required by men who would serve the church as elders. Discuss the ways these qualities differ from the biblical expectation of all saved men. Look closely at the lists provided in verses 6-9 and verses 10-16. List the contrasts that you see and discuss what those differences mean. Think back to Ecclesiastes where Solomon urged us to enjoy life. How does this message fit with what Paul said in verse 15? How does this apply to us? Why must we stay away from and silence false teachers? Next Steps Think about the preachers you listen to every day or every week. Are they leading you to embrace Christ, or are they leading away from Christ? Based on your answer, what action should you take?\nPrayer Focus Pray for the elders of CrossPointe Church and pray especially that God would raise up additional elders to share the load by teaching and leading.\n","wordCount":"468","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-11-06T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-11-06T00:00:00Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://smallgroup.carrollmedia.dev/posts/2022/autumn/week-6/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Small Group Notes","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://smallgroup.carrollmedia.dev/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><script src=/prayer.js></script><script>window.onload=init</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://smallgroup.carrollmedia.dev/ accesskey=h title="Small Group Notes (Alt + H)">Small Group Notes</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button><ul class=lang-switch><li>|</li></ul></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a class=float-right href=/prayer-tracker>Prayer &#128591;</a></li></ul></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><h1 class=post-title>The Men Who Must Speak & The Men Who Must Be Silenced</h1><div class=post-meta>&lt;span title='2022-11-06 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>November 6, 2022&lt;/span></div></header><div class=post-content><h2 id=announcements>Announcements<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#announcements>#</a></h2><ul><li>Vote on Tuesday!</li><li>2023 Budget Presentation after morning worship on November 13th.</li><li>Church Christmas Decorating: November 20th after morning worship.</li></ul><h2 id=big-idea>Big Idea<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#big-idea>#</a></h2><p>A well-ordered church is led by elders who teach and protect God’s people.</p><h2 id=read-titus-15-16>Read: Titus 1:5-16<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#read-titus-15-16>#</a></h2><p>This is why I left you in Crete, so that you might put what remained into order, and appoint elders in every town as I directed you— 6if anyone is above reproach, the husband of one wife, and his children are believers and not open to the charge of debauchery or insubordination. 7For an overseer, as God’s steward, must be above reproach.
