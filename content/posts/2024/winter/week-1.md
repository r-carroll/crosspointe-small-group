# Big Idea
The Domino Effect
Those whom God has saved must serve Him. 
## Read: 
Joshua [24:14-15](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/JOS.24.ESV)

## Discussion Questions
1. What insight, principle, or observation from this week’s sermon was the most helpful, eye- opening, or troubling? Explain.
2. Read verses 1-13. What are some things that you find significant in those verses? Discuss what you’ve found and why those insights are important.
3. Joshua commanded the people to serve the Lord—are we under the same command? Why or why not?
4. Joshua made a choice for himself and his family and challenged Israel to do the same. If you choose not to serve the Lord, what does your choice reveal about your heart and life?
5. Read Luke 9:23. Is there a difference between serving and following Jesus? What does He say about serving Him on our terms?

## Next Steps
Serve the Lord is the theme for 2024 at CrossPointe Church. Take inventory this week of your service to the Lord through the church.
## Prayer Focus
As we enter a new year, please pray that the church's needs will be met by the people God has placed in the church. Also, pray for those who currently serve and make CrossPointe effective in leading people to connect and commit to Jesus.
