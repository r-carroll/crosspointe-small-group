Big Idea: Salvation is only possible because of the person and work of Jesus. Anyone who is seeking eternal life must go to Jesus and simply repent of their sins and trust in Him for salvation. Jesus invites people to have life.
Read: Matthew 19:16-30 16 And behold, a man came up to him, saying, ‚ÄúTeacher, what good deed must I do to have eternal life?‚Äù 17 And he said to him, ‚ÄúWhy do you ask me about what is good? There is only one who is good. If you would enter life, keep the commandments.‚Äù 18 He said to him, ‚ÄúWhich ones?‚Äù And Jesus said, ‚ÄúYou shall not murder, You shall not commit adultery, You shall not steal, You shall not bear false witness, 19 Honor your father and mother, and, You shall love your neighbor as yourself.‚Äù 20 The young man said to him, ‚ÄúAll these I have kept. What do I still lack?‚Äù 21 Jesus said to him, ‚ÄúIf you would be perfect, go, sell what you possess and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me.‚Äù 22 When the young man heard this he went away sorrowful, for he had great possessions.

19 He entered Jericho and was passing through. 2 And behold, there was a man named Zacchaeus. He was a chief tax collector and was rich. 3 And he was seeking to see who Jesus was, but on account of the crowd he could not, because he was small in stature. 4 So he ran on ahead and climbed up into a sycamore tree to see him, for he was about to pass that way. 5 And when Jesus came to the place, he looked up and said to him, ‚ÄúZacchaeus, hurry and come down, for I must stay at your house today.‚Äù 6 So he hurried and came down and received him joyfully. 7 And when they saw it, they all grumbled, ‚ÄúHe has gone in to be the guest of a man who is a sinner.‚Äù 8 And Zacchaeus stood and said to the Lord, ‚ÄúBehold, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor. And if I have defrauded anyone of anything, I restore it fourfold.‚Äù 9 And Jesus said to him, ‚ÄúToday salvation has come to this house, since he also is a son of Abraham. 10 For the Son of Man came to seek and to save the lost.‚Äù

‚ÄúDo not think that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I have not come to bring peace, but a sword. For I have come to set a man against his father, and a daughter against her mother, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law. And a person‚Äôs enemies will be those of his own household. Whoever loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me, and whoever loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.

Read: Matthew 6:25-34 ‚ÄúTherefore I tell you, do not be anxious about your life, what you will eat or what you will drink, nor about your body, what you will put on. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothing? ‚ÄúTherefore do not be anxious about tomorrow, for tomorrow will be anxious for itself. Sufficient for the day is its own trouble. Look at the birds of the air: they neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not of more value than they? And which of you by being anxious can add a single hour to his span of life? And why are you anxious about clothing? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow: they neither toil nor spin, yet I tell you, even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these. But if God so clothes the grass of the field, which today is alive and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, will he not much more clothe you, O you of little faith? Therefore do not be anxious, saying, ‚ÄòWhat shall we eat?‚Äô or ‚ÄòWhat shall we drink?‚Äô or ‚ÄòWhat shall we wear?‚Äô For the Gentiles seek after all these things, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them all. But seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be added to you.

Read: Titus 2:1-10 But as for you, teach what accords with sound doctrine. 2Older men are to be sober-minded, dignified, self-controlled, sound in faith, in love, and in steadfastness. 3Older women likewise are to be reverent in behavior, not slanderers or slaves to much wine. They are to teach what is good, 4and so train the young women to love their husbands and children, 5to be self-controlled, pure, working at home, kind, and submissive to their own husbands, that the word of God may not be reviled. 6Likewise, urge the younger men to be self-controlled. 7Show yourself in all respects to be a model of good works, and in your teaching show integrity, dignity, 8and sound speech that cannot be condemned, so that an opponent may be put to shame, having nothing evil to say about us. 9Bondservants are to be submissive to their own masters in everything; they are to be well-pleasing, not argumentative, 10not pilfering, but showing all good faith, so that in everything they may adorn the doctrine of God our Savior.

Church Christmas Decorating: November 20th after morning worship. Big Idea A well-ordered church is led by elders who teach and protect God‚Äôs people.
Read: Titus 1:5-16 This is why I left you in Crete, so that you might put what remained into order, and appoint elders in every town as I directed you‚Äî 6if anyone is above reproach, the husband of one wife, and his children are believers and not open to the charge of debauchery or insubordination. 7For an overseer, as God‚Äôs steward, must be above reproach. He must not be arrogant or quick-tempered or a drunkard or violent or greedy for gain, 8but hospitable, a lover of good, self-controlled, upright, holy, and disciplined. 9He must hold firm to the trustworthy word as taught, so that he may be able to give instruction in sound doctrine and also to rebuke those who contradict it. 10For there are many who are insubordinate, empty talkers and deceivers, especially those of the circumcision party. 11They must be silenced, since they are upsetting whole families by teaching for shameful gain what they ought not to teach. 12One of the Cretans, a prophet of their own, said, ‚ÄúCretans are always liars, evil beasts, lazy gluttons.‚Äù 13This testimony is true. Therefore rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith, 14not devoting themselves to Jewish myths and the commands of people who turn away from the truth. 15To the pure, all things are pure, but to the defiled and unbelieving, nothing is pure; but both their minds and their consciences are defiled. 16They profess to know God, but they deny him by their works. They are detestable, disobedient, unfit for any good work.
