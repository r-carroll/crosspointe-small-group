With this charge we often reflect on the evangelism aspect and sometimes forget the call given of baptizing believers, and following the commands, and teaching of Jesus. It is important to remember these teachings, and as a church to carry out the ordinances that Christ established for His bride.\nText Matthew 28:16-20\nThe 11 disciples traveled to Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had directed them. 17. When they saw Him, they worshiped, but some doubted. 18. Then Jesus came near and said to them, “All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth. 19. Go, therefore, and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, 20. teaching them to observe everything I have commanded you. And remember, I am with you always, to the end of the age.\nDiscussion Questions What is the importance of the local church following the commands of Christ? In Acts 2:41 we see that 3,000 were added to the “Them” How were they added, and what were they added to? In some translations such as the KJV “unto them” is italicized indicating it is not part of the original texts. For this reason, other translations such as ESV, NASB, YLT, etc. leave off unto them entirely and render it were added that day instead. Regardless, this does not change how they were added or what they were added to. Read through the end of the chapter for extra context.\nWhy is it important to understand Baptism \u0026 the Lord’s Supper? Is it ok to not partake in the Lord’s Supper? Hint: Read 1 Corinthians 11:17-34.\nNext Steps Over the week, prepare your heart to take the Lord’s Supper and spend time reflecting and evaluating your life using the following three questions: Do you have unconfessed sin? Are you living as if the remembrance of what Jesus has done doesn’t matter? Lastly, do you have strife or anger against a brother or sister in Christ that needs to be taken care of? The next step for some is obedience through following in believer’s baptism.\nPrayer Focus Prepare your heart this week and pray that as a church our hearts are ready to take the Lord’s Supper Sunday.\n","wordCount":"405","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-07-31T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-07-31T00:00:00Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://smallgroup.carrollmedia.dev/posts/2022/summer/week-4/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Small Group Notes","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://smallgroup.carrollmedia.dev/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><script src=/prayer.js></script><script>window.onload=init</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://smallgroup.carrollmedia.dev/ accesskey=h title="Small Group Notes (Alt + H)">Small Group Notes</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a class=float-right href=/prayer-tracker>Prayer &#128591;</a></li></ul></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><h1 class=post-title>Dearest Place on Earth - Part 4</h1><div class=post-meta>&lt;span title='2022-07-31 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>July 31, 2022&lt;/span></div></header><div class=post-content><h1 id=week-4---the-dearest-place-on-earth>Week 4 - The Dearest Place on Earth<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#week-4---the-dearest-place-on-earth>#</a></h1><h2 id=big-idea>Big Idea<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#big-idea>#</a></h2><p>We are given a charge in Matthew 28 that we refer to as the great commission.
