With this charge we often reflect on the evangelism aspect and sometimes forget the call given of baptizing believers, and following the commands, and teaching of Jesus. It is important to remember these teachings, and as a church to carry out the ordinances that Christ established for His bride.

Scripture Reading 1 Corinthians 12:12-20 12
For just as the body is one and has many members, and all the members of the body, though many, are one body, so it is with Christ. 13 For in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body‚ÄîJews or Greeks, slaves or free‚Äîand all were made to drink of one Spirit. 14 For the body does not consist of one member but of many. 15 If the foot should say, ‚ÄúBecause I am not a hand, I do not belong to the body,‚Äù that would not make it any less a part of the body. 16 And if the ear should say, ‚ÄúBecause I am not an eye, I do not belong to the body,‚Äù that would not make it any less a part of the body. 17 If the whole body were an eye, where would be the sense of hearing? If the whole body were an ear, where would be the sense of smell? 18 But as it is, God arranged the members in the body, each one of them, as he chose. 19 If all were a single member, where would the body be? 20 As it is, there are many parts, yet one body.

Scripture reading Acts 2:36-47
Let all the house of Israel therefore know for certain that God has made him both Lord and Christ, this Jesus whom you crucified.‚Äù 37 Now when they heard this they were cut to the heart, and said to Peter and the rest of the apostles, ‚ÄúBrothers, what shall we do?‚Äù 38 And Peter said to them, ‚ÄúRepent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. 39 For the promise is for you and for your children and for all who are far off, everyone whom the Lord our God calls to himself.‚Äù 40 And with many other words he bore witness and continued to exhort them, saying, ‚ÄúSave yourselves from this crooked generation.‚Äù 41 So those who received his word were baptized, and there were added that day about three thousand souls. 42 And they devoted themselves to the apostles‚Äô teaching and the fellowship, to the breaking of bread and the prayers. 43 And awe came upon every soul, and many wonders and signs were being done through the apostles. 44 And all who believed were together and had all things in common. 45 And they were selling their possessions and belongings and distributing the proceeds to all, as any had need. 46 And day by day, attending the temple together and breaking bread in their homes, they received their food with glad and generous hearts, 47 praising God and having favor with all the people. And the Lord added to their number day by day those who were being saved.

This shapes everything that we do. Every church should be obedient to the headship of Christ and submissive to the truths that he taught.
Scripture reading Matthew 16:13-20
13 Now when Jesus came into the district of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, ‚ÄúWho do people say that the Son of Man is?‚Äù 14 And they said, ‚ÄúSome say John the Baptist, others say Elijah, and others Jeremiah or one of the prophets.‚Äù 15 He said to them, ‚ÄúBut who do you say that I am?‚Äù 16 Simon Peter replied, ‚ÄúYou are the Christ, the Son of the living God.‚Äù 17 And Jesus answered him, ‚ÄúBlessed are you, Simon Bar-Jonah! For flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven. 18 And I tell you, you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. 19 I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.‚Äù 20 Then he strictly charged the disciples to tell no one that he was the Christ.
