## Ice Breaker
What’s one big decision or moment in your life when you had to rely on someone else’s
instructions or guidance? How did it feel to trust them, and did it turn out the way you
expected?

## Big Idea
You must trust God even when you don’t want to trust Him.

## Read: 
[Deuteronomy 1:19-21, 26](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/PRO.3.ESV)

## Discussion Questions
1. Read 1:26-27: How does fear distort our view of God’s character, and why is this so
dangerous?
2. Read 1:28-33: Why is it easier to focus on obstacles than on God’s power? What
does this reveal about our faith?
3. Read 1:34-35, 40: How does disobedience show a lack of trust in God, and what are the
consequences of disobedience in our lives?
4. Read 1:42-44: Why is presumption (acting without God) so dangerous, and how is it
different from genuine faith?
5. Read: 1:30; John 14:1: How does this passage ultimately point us to Christ, and why
is He the answer to our failure to trust God?

## Next Steps
Identify one tangible way you can demonstrate trust in God this week by stepping outside
your comfort zone. Maybe it’s having a difficult conversation, saying yes to something He’s
calling you to, or surrendering control in a specific area of your life. Write it down as a
commitment and ask someone in the group to pray for you as you take this step. At the end
of the week, reflect on how taking action grew your faith and prepared you to trust Him more
in the future.

## Prayer Focus
Ask God to cultivate a deeper trust in Him in every area of your life. Pray for the courage to
surrender fear, overcome doubt, and step forward in obedience, even when the path feels
uncertain.
