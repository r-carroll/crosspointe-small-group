## Scripture:
[Romans 4:01-13](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/ROM.4.ESV)

## Discussion Questions
1. What did Abraham and his legacy mean to the Jewish people and what was Paul's purpose of bringing him up in this passage?
2. How did Abraham exhibit faith in Genesis 15:4-11?
3. What does Abraham's sinfulness reveal to us?
4. In verses 5 and 6, what does the phrase "God counts/imputes righteousness" mean?
5. What are the conditions if any of God imputing his righteousness?
6. Scripture explains that righteousness is a gift for all people. How does this help us understand God's heart for the lost?

## Next Steps
Continue working on the prayer challenge! We are roughly 3 hours behind this week, but there's still time to catch up! We have a weekly goal of ~9 hours.

## Prayer Focus
In this passage we see God's heart for the lost. Pray that your own heart reflects God's and for opportunities to witness to the lost this week.
