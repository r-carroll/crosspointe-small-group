## Read
Luke 19:1-10

19 He entered Jericho and was passing through. 2 And behold, there was a man named Zacchaeus. He was a chief tax collector and was rich. 3 And he was seeking to see who Jesus was, but on account of the crowd he could not, because he was small in stature. 4 So he ran on ahead and climbed up into a sycamore tree to see him, for he was about to pass that way. 5 And when Jesus came to the place, he looked up and said to him, “Zacchaeus, hurry and come down, for I must stay at your house today.” 6 So he hurried and came down and received him joyfully. 7 And when they saw it, they all grumbled, “He has gone in to be the guest of a man who is a sinner.” 8 And Zacchaeus stood and said to the Lord, “Behold, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor. And if I have defrauded anyone of anything, I restore it fourfold.” 9 And Jesus said to him, “Today salvation has come to this house, since he also is a son of Abraham. 10 For the Son of Man came to seek and to save the lost.”

## Big Idea: 
A follower of Christ will put Christ and his commandments above everyone including
self.

## Discussion Questions:
1. What were some takeaways from Sunday’s message?
2. Why are good works an indication of salvation?
3. Define repentance & good works and explain the differences between them.
4. Why is it important to be conscious of Idols in our lives, and to remove them?

## Next Steps: 
What idol must you remove from your life to better follow, or to begin following
Christ?

## Prayer Focus: 
Pray for one another this week for the removal of idols present in our lives.
