## Big Idea
Gifted To Serve
Serve The Lord: Week 3 | Week of January 21, 2024
God gives people gifts with which they can serve Him. Read: 1 Corinthians 12:4-11
> This week's discussion centers around spiritual gifts and using those gifts. 
To help you identify the gifts you've been given if you don't already know what yours are,
you can [take the assessment here](https://groupleaders.org/curriculum-feed/spiritual-gift-assessment). Open the resource guide in another tab as you watch the video. 
## Discussion Questions
1. What insight, principle, or observation from this week’s sermon was the most helpful, eye- opening, or troubling? Explain.
2. Have you ever been hindered from serving because you did not think you had anything to offer? Did you overcome that belief? If so, what helped you gain the confidence to serve?
3. How are spiritual gifts different from talents or skills you may already possess?
4. How does exercising spiritual gifts promote unity in the church?
5. What spiritual gift(s) have you been given? How do you know what gift(s) you possess?
## Next Steps
If you don’t already know, try to determine your spiritual gift(s) this week. Then, examine how you use your gift(s) at CrossPointe.
