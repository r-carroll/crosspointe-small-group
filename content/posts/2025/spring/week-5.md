## Icebreaker Question
What’s the most ridiculous thing you’ve ever held onto ‘just in case’
—but never
used again?

## Read
[Romans 8:35-39](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/ROM.8.ESV)

## Questions
1. What kinds of suffering or hardship might cause someone to question God’s
love—and how does Paul confront that fear in this passage?
2. How does Paul’s use of the word “who” (not “what”) in verse 35 change the
way we think about separation from Christ’s love?
3. Paul says we are “more than conquerors” through Christ’s love. What do you
think that means? How is this different from just surviving hardship?
4. What lies are exposed by the truth that nothing—life or death, angels or
rulers, things present or future—can separate you from the love of God in
Christ?

## Next Steps 
Identify personal fears or lies about
God’s love, and write gospel truths
from this passage beside each one.

## Prayer Focus
Thank God for the permanent, pursuing
love of Christ that never fades, fails, or
abandons
