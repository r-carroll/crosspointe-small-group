## Big Idea
Every Christian is a slave.

## Read: 
[Romans 6:15-23](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/ROM.6.ESV)

## Discussion Questions
1. What insight, principle, or observation from this week’s sermon was the most helpful, eye-
opening, or troubling? Explain.
2. What does Paul mean in Romans 6:15 when he asks, “Shall we sin because we are not
under the law but under grace?”
3. How does Paul use the analogy of slavery in verses 16-18? What does it mean to be a
“slave to righteousness”?
4. In verse 21, Paul asks, “What benefit did you reap at that time from the things you are
now ashamed of?” How does this question help us understand the consequences of sin?
5. Romans 6:23 states, “For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in
Christ Jesus our Lord.” How does this verse summarize the message of the passage, and
why is it significant?

## Next Steps
This week, spend a few minutes each day reading Romans 6:15-23 and ask God to deepen your
understanding of being “alive to God” and “enslaved to righteousness.” Reflect on how you can
actively live out this truth in your daily choices. Try sharing one insight or change you’ve
experienced with someone who could encourage you in this journey.

## Prayer Focus
As you enter the month of November, make the focus of your prayers expressing gratitude to God
for all He’s done in bringing you from death to life
