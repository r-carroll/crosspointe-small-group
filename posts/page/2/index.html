Read: Romans 5:15-21
Discussion Questions What insight, principle, or observation from this week‚Äôs sermon was the most helpful, eye- opening, or troubling? Explain. What is the main contrast between Adam‚Äôs trespass and Christ‚Äôs gift in Romans 5:15? What does Paul mean when he says that ‚Äúgrace reigns through righteousness‚Äù in Romans 5:21? How does understanding Adam as a ‚Äútype‚Äù of Christ help us grasp the significance of Christ‚Äôs work (Romans 5:14, 18-19)? Next Steps Let grace, not guilt or fear, reign in your life. Consider how you can allow God‚Äôs grace to shape your attitudes, decisions, and relationships. When faced with temptation or difficulty, remind yourself that you are no longer under the reign of sin and death, but under the reign of grace. Actively seek to reflect Christ‚Äôs righteousness in your daily life, extending grace to others as you have received it from God.

Read: Romans 5:1-11
Discussion Questions How does understanding our justification by faith change our perspective on difficult circumstances? What role does ‚Äúpeace with God‚Äù play in changing our attitude toward life‚Äôs challenges? How can the hope of sharing in God‚Äôs glory influence our focus in daily life? In what ways does God‚Äôs love, demonstrated through Christ‚Äôs sacrifice, transform our attitudes toward ourselves and others? Why would God allow us to suffer even while actively working in our lives? Next Steps When you encounter difficult circumstances, practice ‚Äúpreaching the gospel to yourself.‚Äù This involves intentionally recalling God‚Äôs promises, Christ‚Äôs sacrifice, and the hope of eternal glory. Write down key verses, like Romans 5:1-5, and keep them handy for quick reference throughout the day. By doing this, you will train your mind to focus on God‚Äôs truth rather than on the challenges, which will transform your attitude and response to trials. When we come back together in October we can share our scripture reference sheets.

Discussion Questions What insight, principle, or observation from this week‚Äôs sermon was the most helpful, eye-opening, or troubling? Explain.
What does Paul mean when he says that Abraham‚Äôs promise did not come through the law but through the righteousness of faith (Romans 4:13)?
How does Paul describe Abraham‚Äôs faith in verses 19-21, and what can we learn from it about trusting God‚Äôs promises?

Discussion Questions What did Abraham and his legacy mean to the Jewish people and what was Paul‚Äôs purpose of bringing him up in this passage? How did Abraham exhibit faith in Genesis 15:4-11? What does Abraham‚Äôs sinfulness reveal to us? In verses 5 and 6, what does the phrase ‚ÄúGod counts/imputes righteousness‚Äù mean? What are the conditions if any of God imputing his righteousness? Scripture explains that righteousness is a gift for all people. How does this help us understand God‚Äôs heart for the lost? Next Steps Continue working on the prayer challenge! We are roughly 3 hours behind this week, but there‚Äôs still time to catch up! We have a weekly goal of ~9 hours.

Discussion Questions In what ways do you see self-righteousness manifest in your life? How do you battle your self-righteous tendencies? Why is it important to recognize that faith itself is not what saves us but rather the work of Jesus Christ? How does Romans 3:29-30 emphasize the unity of Jews and Gentiles in terms of faith? What implications does this have for how we view others in our faith community and beyond? In Romans 3:31, Paul states, ‚ÄúDo we then overthrow the law by this faith? By no means! On the contrary, we uphold the law.‚Äù How can we reconcile the role of the law with the principle of justification by faith? How should our understanding of the law change in light of being justified by faith? Next Steps It‚Äôs important that we continually recognize the grace and mercy God has shown us. Instead of buying into the false notion that we are basically good people, consider the truth that God has saved you through faith in the person and work of His Son and focus on putting aside all boasting so that you may only exalt God in and through your life.

Small Group Discussion This week concluded this mini-series, which was an extension of the original ‚ÄúServe the Lord‚Äù series from January of this year. What will you stick with you from these messages on Christian service? What does Paul mean when he says that the Gentiles walk in the ‚Äúfutility of their minds‚Äù (vs. 17)? Why are their minds this way? In verse 19, Paul notes that the Gentiles ‚Äúhave become callous,‚Äù giving themselves up to sin. What can we do to seek not to be similarly callous? In verse 23, Paul directs Christians to ‚Äúbe renewed in the spirit of your minds.‚Äù Read also Rom 12:1-2. What does it mean to be ‚Äúrenewed‚Äù this way? How do we pursue it? Next Steps: Consider ways you can enrich your personal and corporate study of the Word of God.

Small Group Discussion What stood out to you from the sermon this week? This week‚Äôs message focused on a psalm. Is there a psalm you have found to be particularly meaningful in your walk with the Lord? Many people today fail to acknowledge with their minds what is true. What are some examples of this? Reread Psalm 32:8-9. What is the contrast between humans and animals in these verses? Why is this significant? How might a failure to engage your mind affect your service to God? Next Steps: Throughout the week, reflect on the many blessings which come from the gift God has given humankind of minds to reason and understand.

Small Group Discussion What stood out to you in this week‚Äôs message? What was good, helpful, convicting, troubling, or led to more questions for you? Why is it so important for each believer to know the Word? Why do you think it is hard for many professing believers to be faithfully involved in a church or place themselves in a position to hear the Word taught? From the message what was the difference between Apostles and Prophets and Evangelists, Shepherds and Teachers? We are called to grow in our faith and knowledge so that we are not carried away by every wind of doctrine, by human cunning, by craftiness in deceitful schemes. Describe some of the false doctrines, human cunning, craftiness, and deceitful schemes you see in the world and even churches today. Next Steps: Invite and encourage others at CrossPointe who don‚Äôt already attend an Adult Bible Education class to attend one with you or to come to Wednesday night Bible Study.

Questions What stood out to you in this week‚Äôs message? What was good, helpful, convicting, troubling, or led to more questions for you? Why is the Word of God so important? Why do you think it can be so difficult for believers to be unified? What is the attitude Paul says the church is to have towards one another? Paul says we are to speak the truth in love. How is this often handled incorrectly and share an example (real or fictional) or how this should look in the church. Next Steps: How much time do you spend in the Word? If you think you should be spending more time studying the Word make a plan this week to follow through on it and possibly use your group to help keep you on track.

Read: Romans 2:1-4
Discussion Questions How does Romans 2:1-4 address the issue of self-righteous judgment? What role does God‚Äôs kindness play in His judgment according to Romans 2:4? How does Paul address moralists in Romans 2:1-3, and what broader message does he convey about sin and judgment through this approach? What warning does the sermon give about presuming upon God‚Äôs mercy, and what should be our correct response to God‚Äôs patience and kindness? Next Steps Consider how the awareness of your own guilt before God and the understanding of His mercy can transform your daily interactions and your overall perspective on life. Let this passage challenge you to live authentically, humbly acknowledging your need for grace and extending that grace to others.
