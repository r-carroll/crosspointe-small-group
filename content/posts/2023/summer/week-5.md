## Main Idea:
You can trust that God is able to keep you from stumbling and present you blameless before
Him.

## Jude 24-25
24 Now to him who is able to keep you from stumbling and to present you blameless before the
presence of his glory with great joy, 25 to the only God, our Savior, through Jesus Christ our
Lord, be glory, majesty, dominion, and authority, before all time and now and forever. Amen.

## Discussion Questions
1. Share personal experiences of how God has kept you from stumbling or helped you grow
in your faith despite facing trials and temptations.
2. What is a doxology, and why is it significant that Jude ends his letter with one? How does
this closing doxology shape our perspective on God's character and what He has done
for us?
3. The first reality presented in the text is that believers are "kept by the power of God."
How does the assurance of God's preserving power impact your faith and daily walk with
Him?
4. The second reality mentioned is that believers will be presented "blameless before the
presence of His glory with great joy." How does the hope of being blameless in God's
presence encourage you, especially in times of struggle and temptation?
5. Discuss the concept of eternal security and the idea of once saved, always saved. How
does the knowledge that God holds onto us and completes the work He started bring
comfort and assurance?
6. Consider the connection between preserving our faith and actively keeping ourselves in
the love of God. How do these two aspects work together in our Christian walk?

## Next Steps: 
This is a message that you will need to be reminded of often. Think about your
habits and the people you have around you and evaluate their influence on you. Reflect on how
God has kept you, and thank Him for His faithfulness in your life.

## Prayer Focus: 
Thank God for keeping you from stumbling. The Lord will keep us and will
present us in His holy presence faultless with great joy. It is in that confident expression that our
worship is rendered to Yahweh and we praise Him in Jesusâ€™s name. Amen.
