What’s Law Got to Do With It?

## Ice Breaker
What’s the most ridiculous or unexpected rule you’ve ever had to follow?

## Big Idea
God’s law is good.

## Read: 
[Romans 7:7-12](

## Discussion Questions
1. How does Paul’s statement, "I would not have known what sin was except through the law"
(Romans 7:7), challenge our understanding of sin before we encounter God's Word?
2. Read Romans 7:8. Why do you think sin takes advantage of the law to provoke more sin?
3. Read Romans 7:9, What does Paul mean by "I died" in this context?
4. How does Paul’s statement that "sin, seizing the opportunity through the commandment,
deceived me, and through the commandment killed me" (Romans 7:11) shed light on the
deceptive power of sin?
5. In Romans 7:12, Paul says, “So then, the law is holy, and the commandment is holy, righteous,
and good.” How can we reconcile the fact that the law reveals sin but is still described as
“holy, righteous, and good”?

## Next Steps
Recognize that the law, though good, exposes the depth of your sin. Spend time reflecting on how
God's commands have revealed areas where you have fallen short, whether in thoughts,
attitudes, or actions. Repent of these areas, acknowledging your need for God’s forgiveness and
grace.

## Prayer Focus
Spend time praying for the upcoming Children’s Christmas program. Pray for all the kids who are
participating and for everyone who will attend and hear the gospel that morning.
