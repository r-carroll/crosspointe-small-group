For you will render to a man according to his work.\nDiscussion Questions What was the most impactful thing from the text and the sermon this week? What does it look like to “wait on the Lord”? Why is it hard to wait silently or what areas in your life do we find it hard to wait? What are other things we put our trust in and how do they fail? What are things in your life that you are waiting on God for? Which of God’s attributes do you find it helpful to remind yourself of while waiting on God? Next Steps Take time this week in your devotional time to pour out your heart before God by writing your own psalm. If you are willing, share it with your group the following week.\nPrayer Focus Pour out your heart to God. As you pray this week tell God everything on your heart. Tell Him your goals, dreams, desires, frustrations, fears, and gratitudes. Tell Him how you feel about Him, and what you think about Him. Ask God to show you areas in your life that you aren’t trusting in Him alone for.\nThis does not have to be a psalm of lament, although it can be, it can be psalm of gratitude, of praise, of encouragement, of testimony. Try and write at least 3 verses. (Sentences) It doesn’t have to compete with Psalm 119. Ephesians 5:19 tells to us speak to one another with psalms. Sing to the Lord a new song.\n","wordCount":"511","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-08-14T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-08-14T00:00:00Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://smallgroup.carrollmedia.dev/posts/2022/summer/week-6/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Small Group Notes","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://smallgroup.carrollmedia.dev/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><script src=/prayer.js></script><script>window.onload=init</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://smallgroup.carrollmedia.dev/ accesskey=h title="Small Group Notes (Alt + H)">Small Group Notes</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button><ul class=lang-switch><li>|</li></ul></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a class=float-right href=/prayer-tracker>Prayer &#128591;</a></li></ul></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><h1 class=post-title>Wait | Trust | Pray</h1><div class=post-meta>&lt;span title='2022-08-14 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>August 14, 2022&lt;/span></div></header><div class=post-content><h2 id=big-idea>Big Idea<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#big-idea>#</a></h2><p>We must remind ourselves to wait and trust in God’s power, love, and justice in all circumstances rather than our own
