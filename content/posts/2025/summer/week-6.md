## Icebreaker
If you could swap places with any historical figure for a day, who would it be
and why?

## Qestions
1. When Paul says,
“Who are you, O man, to answer back to God?” (v. 20), how
does that challenge the way we often approach difficult doctrines? What
does it reveal about how we view ourselves in relation to God?
2. How do you respond emotionally and spiritually to the idea that God shapes
people for different purposes? What makes this truth hard—or freeing—to
accept?
3. What do verses 22–24 suggest about why God displays both His wrath and
His mercy? How does this reshape your view of His glory and justice?
4. How does it change your understanding of grace to realize that God’s people
are not defined by lineage, tradition, or effort—but by His sovereign calling?
5. Paul closes this section with a reminder that only a remnant of Israel is saved.
What does that teach us about God’s faithfulness, even when many reject
Him?

## Next Steps
Reflect on one truth from this passage
that stretched your thinking or stirred
your heart. Write it down and revisit it
daily this week. Ask God to deepen your
trust in His character—even when His
ways are beyond your understanding

## Prayer Focus
_Praise_ God for being sovereign, just, and
merciful—perfect in all His ways.

_Confess_ any areas where you've resisted God's
authority or demanded answers He hasn’t
given.

_Thank_ Him for calling you by His mercy and
making you part of His people.

_Ask_ for a heart that delights in God's will, even
when it challenges your assumptions.

_Intercede_ for those who don’t yet know Christ,
that they would be called by His grace
