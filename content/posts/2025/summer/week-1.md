## Icebreaker 
Share a time when you thought you knew what you were
doing, only to find out later it was a mistake.

1. What does it practically look like to ‘lean on your own understanding’ in
everyday life?
2. Why is sin never truly private? How did Achan’s actions affect others in his
family and community
3. What role does community play in helping us trust the Lord and avoid sin?
4. How do we discern the difference between human wisdom and God’s wisdom
when they conflict?
5. What do we learn about God’s character from His response to Achan’s sin
and Israel’s repentance?
6. How do we see the gospel in Joshua 7

## Next Steps
Identify one area where you’ve been relying on
your own understanding, and write out a prayer of
surrender to God in that area.

## Prayer Focus
“Father, teach us to trust You more than ourselves.”
Pray for sensitivity to the Spirit’s conviction.
Pray for courage to confess sin and walk in the light.
Pray for a deeper love for God’s Word and trust in His
promises.
Pray that each person would rest in Christ’s
righteousness, not their own understanding or works
