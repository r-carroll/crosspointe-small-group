He also has some advice for us: we should do what we can to remove discouragement from our souls and to minimize damage to our bodies. This is not a call to deny the very real suffering that everyone experiences. Nor is it a call to escape pain by living for pleasure. Rather, it is a call to take care of our mental and physical health.</description></item><item><title>What You Don’t Know Can Hurt You</title><link>https://smallgroup.carrollmedia.dev/posts/2022/autumn/week-2/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://smallgroup.carrollmedia.dev/posts/2022/autumn/week-2/</guid><description>Big Idea Incomplete knowledge is not always a reason for inaction.
Read: Ecclesiastes 11:1-6 Cast your bread upon the waters, for you will find it after many days. 2 Give a portion to seven, or even to eight, for you know not what disaster may happen on earth. 3If the clouds are full of rain, they empty themselves on the earth, and if a tree falls to the south or to the north, in the place where the tree falls, there it will lie.</description></item><item><title>The World Turned Upside Down</title><link>https://smallgroup.carrollmedia.dev/posts/2022/autumn/week-1/</link><pubDate>Sun, 02 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://smallgroup.carrollmedia.dev/posts/2022/autumn/week-1/</guid><description>Big Idea Life is filled with risk, so choose wisdom over foolishness.
Read: Ecclesiastes 10:4-20 If the anger of the ruler rises against you, do not leave your place, for calmness will lay great offenses to rest. 5There is an evil that I have seen under the sun, as it were an error proceeding from the ruler: 6folly is set in many high places, and the rich sit in a low place.</description></item><item><title>The World Turned Upside Down - Supplement</title><link>https://smallgroup.carrollmedia.dev/posts/2022/autumn/week-1-supplement/</link><pubDate>Sun, 02 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://smallgroup.carrollmedia.dev/posts/2022/autumn/week-1-supplement/</guid><description>Question 3 Listen to the talk that goes on in your home. How much of it is impatient and unkind? How often are words spoken out of selfishness and personal desire? How easily do outbursts of anger occur? How often do we bring up past wrongs? How do we fail to communicate hope? How do we fail to protect? How often do our words carry threats that we have “had it” and are about to quit?</description></item><item><title>Meaningless: Week 12</title><link>https://smallgroup.carrollmedia.dev/posts/2022/summer/week-8/</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://smallgroup.carrollmedia.dev/posts/2022/summer/week-8/</guid><description>Making Sense of a Crooked World Big Idea God is not to blame for this crooked world.
Read: Ecclesiastes 7:15-29 In my vain life I have seen everything. There is a righteous man who perishes in his righteousness, and there is a wicked man who prolongs his life in his evildoing. 16 Be not overly righteous, and do not make yourself too wise. Why should you destroy yourself? 17 Be not overly wicked, neither be a fool.</description></item><item><title>Meaningless: Week 11</title><link>https://smallgroup.carrollmedia.dev/posts/2022/summer/week-7/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://smallgroup.carrollmedia.dev/posts/2022/summer/week-7/</guid><description>The Dash in the Middle Big Idea Life is serious business
Read: Ecclesiastes 7:1-14
A good name is better than precious ointment, and the day of death than the day of birth. 2It is better to go to the house of mourning than to go to the house of feasting, for this is the end of all mankind, and the living will lay it to heart. 3Sorrow is better than laughter, for by sadness of face the heart is made glad.</description></item><item><title>Wait | Trust | Pray</title><link>https://smallgroup.carrollmedia.dev/posts/2022/summer/week-6/</link><pubDate>Sun, 14 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://smallgroup.carrollmedia.dev/posts/2022/summer/week-6/</guid><description>Big Idea We must remind ourselves to wait and trust in God’s power, love, and justice in all circumstances rather than our own intellect and power, because God alone is Sovereign.
Scripture reading Psalm 62
For God alone my soul waits in silence; from him comes my salvation. 2 He alone is my rock and my salvation, my fortress; I shall not be greatly shaken. 3 How long will all of you attack a man to batter him, like a leaning wall, a tottering fence?</description></item><item><title>Is being single better?</title><link>https://smallgroup.carrollmedia.dev/posts/rabbit-trails/is-singleness-better/</link><pubDate>Sat, 13 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://smallgroup.carrollmedia.dev/posts/rabbit-trails/is-singleness-better/</guid><description>Disclaimer: The opinions expressed in this article are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of CrossPointe church.

When it comes to being single or married, which is better? In 1 Corinthians 7 is Paul saying being single is better than being married? To find the answer to this, let&amp;rsquo;s first establish the context we are diving into.</description></item><item><title>Dearest Place on Earth - Part 5</title><link>https://smallgroup.carrollmedia.dev/posts/2022/summer/week-5/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://smallgroup.carrollmedia.dev/posts/2022/summer/week-5/</guid><description>What Is Precious to Jesus? Big Idea The Church is Precious to Jesus!
Read: Ephesians 5:22-32
Discussion Questions What was the most impactful thing from the text and the sermon this week? The church is called to submit to Christ, name some ways we struggle to submit and discuss how we can better follow the headship of our Savior. Separation and sanctification are presented together in verses 26-27. Talk about why these two things are necessary in the life of every believer.</description></item><item><title>Dearest Place on Earth - Part 4</title><link>https://smallgroup.carrollmedia.dev/posts/2022/summer/week-4/</link><pubDate>Sun, 31 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://smallgroup.carrollmedia.dev/posts/2022/summer/week-4/</guid><description>Week 4 - The Dearest Place on Earth Big Idea We are given a charge in Matthew 28 that we refer to as the great commission. With this charge we often reflect on the evangelism aspect and sometimes forget the call given of baptizing believers, and following the commands, and teaching of Jesus. It is important to remember these teachings, and as a church to carry out the ordinances that Christ established for His bride.</description></item><item><title>Dearest Place on Earth - Part 3</title><link>https://smallgroup.carrollmedia.dev/posts/2022/summer/week-3/</link><pubDate>Sun, 24 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://smallgroup.carrollmedia.dev/posts/2022/summer/week-3/</guid><description>Week 3 - The Dearest Place on Earth Big Idea Church Membership matters for the good of believers to edify and strengthen them in their walk with Jesus and for unbelievers who will know they follow Jesus by the way they love one another.
Scripture Reading 1 Corinthians 12:12-20 12
For just as the body is one and has many members, and all the members of the body, though many, are one body, so it is with Christ.</description></item><item><title>Dearest Place on Earth - Part 2</title><link>https://smallgroup.carrollmedia.dev/posts/2022/summer/week-2/</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://smallgroup.carrollmedia.dev/posts/2022/summer/week-2/</guid><description>Big Idea The local Church is by God’s design, the place for us to grow in the Word of God, as we commit to Him and each other, with hearts that please Him in all that we do.
Scripture reading Acts 2:36-47
Let all the house of Israel therefore know for certain that God has made him both Lord and Christ, this Jesus whom you crucified.” 37 Now when they heard this they were cut to the heart, and said to Peter and the rest of the apostles, “Brothers, what shall we do?</description></item><item><title>Dearest Place on Earth - Part 1</title><link>https://smallgroup.carrollmedia.dev/posts/2022/summer/week-1/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://smallgroup.carrollmedia.dev/posts/2022/summer/week-1/</guid><description>Big Idea Ekklesia simply means “those who are called out.” As the Church, we are a group of believers called out by God from slavery of sin through faith in Jesus Christ. This shapes everything that we do. Every church should be obedient to the headship of Christ and submissive to the truths that he taught.
Scripture reading Matthew 16:13-20
13 Now when Jesus came into the district of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, “Who do people say that the Son of Man is?</description></item></channel></rss>
