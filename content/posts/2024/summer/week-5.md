## Scripture:
[Romans 3:27-31](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/ROM.3.ESV)

## Discussion Questions
1. In what ways do you see self-righteousness manifest in your life? How do you battle your
self-righteous tendencies?
2. Why is it important to recognize that faith itself is not what saves us but rather the work
of Jesus Christ?
3. How does Romans 3:29-30 emphasize the unity of Jews and Gentiles in terms of faith?
What implications does this have for how we view others in our faith community and
beyond?
4. In Romans 3:31, Paul states, "Do we then overthrow the law by this faith? By no means!
On the contrary, we uphold the law." How can we reconcile the role of the law with the
principle of justification by faith? How should our understanding of the law change in light
of being justified by faith?

## Next Steps
Itâ€™s important that we continually recognize the grace and mercy God has shown us. Instead of
buying into the false notion that we are basically good people, consider the truth that God has
saved you through faith in the person and work of His Son and focus on putting aside all boasting
so that you may only exalt God in and through your life.

What reading goals do we want to set?

them and to use them to point lost people to Christ.
