## Question 3

>Once again the Preacher is honest about the troubles of life, both physical
and psychological. He also has some advice for us: we should do what we
can to remove discouragement from our souls and to minimize damage to
our bodies. This is not a call to deny the very real suffering that everyone
experiences. Nor is it a call to escape pain by living for pleasure. Rather, it is
a call to take care of our mental and physical health.
If we are getting discouraged by various vexations, and if we are tempted
therefore to become depressed or disillusioned, we should do what the
Preacher says and remove those vexations from our hearts. This starts with
refusing to feel sorry for ourselves. Rather than dwelling on all the things
that are going wrong, we should count our blessings. We should also seek
the care of a pastor or the counsel of Christian friends—brothers and sisters
in Christ who are sympathetic to our situation but also able to see our
situation for what it is and tell us what we need to hear, especially from the
Scriptures.
But the very best remedy for vexation is to go to God in prayer, telling him
all our troubles. “Do not be anxious about anything”—or vexed about
anything, we might say—“but in everything by prayer and supplication with
thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God.” This command is
then followed by a promise: “And the peace of God, which surpasses all
understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus”
(Philippians 4:6–7). The Biblical way of removing vexation is to cast our
cares on God.

## Question 4
>When we are young it is so easy to forget the one who made us. It is so
easy to think about ourselves. There are so many things to experience
and learn and do. Well, here is the most important thing we can learn and
do: “Remember your Creator”....To remember your Creator is more than
to recall that there is a Creator, more also than to think about Him from
time-to-time. To remember your Creator means to bring to mind daily
what your Creator has done for you and to act on this knowledge. To
remember your Creator is to make God central in your life and to focus
your life on doing His will.
