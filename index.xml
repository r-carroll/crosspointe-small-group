With this charge we often reflect on the evangelism aspect and sometimes forget the call given of baptizing believers, and following the commands, and teaching of Jesus. It is important to remember these teachings, and as a church to carry out the ordinances that Christ established for His bride.</description></item><item><title>Dearest Place on Earth - Part 3</title><link>https://smallgroup.carrollmedia.dev/posts/2022/summer/week-3/</link><pubDate>Sun, 24 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://smallgroup.carrollmedia.dev/posts/2022/summer/week-3/</guid><description>Week 3 - The Dearest Place on Earth Big Idea Church Membership matters for the good of believers to edify and strengthen them in their walk with Jesus and for unbelievers who will know they follow Jesus by the way they love one another.
