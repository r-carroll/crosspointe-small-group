## Announcements
* Men and Women in Prayer is this Saturday at 8:30am
* November 6th: Lord’s Supper and Fall-Back Sunday

## Big Idea
God can be trusted; therefore, your life can be built on who God is and what God has
done.

## Read: Titus 1:1-4

## Discussion Questions
1. What was the most impactful thing from the text and the sermon this week?
2. Read vs. 1. Paul identified himself as a “servant of God and an apostle of Jesus
Christ.” Why do you believe these two titles are significant and what does this
teach us about our identity?
3. Read vs. 2. What does the fact that God cannot lie reveal? How does this aspect
of God’s nature affect or encourage you?
4. Paul called Titus his “true child”—what can we learn from the relationship
between Titus and Paul?

## Next Steps
What do you hope to learn from our study in Titus? Take time this week to read through
this short letter and write down three things you want God to do in your life.

## Prayer Focus
Pray for the Mandeville family as they grieve the death of Nathan. Ask God to provide
comfort and peace in the midst of this storm.
