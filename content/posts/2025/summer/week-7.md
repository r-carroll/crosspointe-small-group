## Read
[Romans 9:30+](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/ROM.9.ESV)

## Icebreaker
If you could receive a lifetime supply of any non-essential item (like coffee,
gum, pens, etc.), what would it be and why?

## Questions
1. How do you believe Paul's audience would have reacted to the truth he
revealed in verses 30–31? What does that say about our preoccupation with
fairness?
2. What does Paul’s use of Isaiah 28:16 in verse 33 teach us about how people
view Christ, and what does it expose about the default position of the heart?
3. Why is zeal without knowledge dangerous? Can you think of modern
parallels?
4. What does it mean to submit to God’s righteousness, and what does refusal
look like in your life?
5. How do Paul’s theology (God’s sovereignty in election) and his practice
(praying for Israel) work together in these verses?

## Next Steps
Practice submitting to God’s
righteousness by beginning each day this
week with a prayer of dependence.

## Prayer Focus
When you pray, ask God to reveal any areas
where you're still clinging to performance,
pride, or comparison. Pray for the Spirit to
deepen your rest in Christ’s finished work and
to replace striving with humble dependence
and gratitude.
