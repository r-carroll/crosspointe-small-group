He must show courtesy to all, compassion for all, and consistency to all. Holding to the Faith in our Lord Jesus Christ, and fulfilling the royal law are key in a faith that works.
James 2:1-13 My brothers, show no partiality as you hold the faith in our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory. 2 For if a man wearing a gold ring and fine clothing comes into your assembly, and a poor man in shabby clothing also comes in, 3 and if you pay attention to the one who wears the fine clothing and say, ‚ÄúYou sit here in a good place,‚Äù while you say to the poor man, ‚ÄúYou stand over there,‚Äù or, ‚ÄúSit down at my feet,‚Äù 4 have you not then made distinctions among yourselves and become judges with evil thoughts? 5 Listen, my beloved brothers, has not God chosen those who are poor in the world to be rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom, which he has promised to those who love him? 6 But you have dishonored the poor man. Are not the rich the ones who oppress you, and the ones who drag you into court? 7 Are they not the ones who blaspheme the honorable name by which you were called? 8 If you really fulfill the royal law according to the Scripture, ‚ÄúYou shall love your neighbor as yourself,‚Äù you are doing well. 9 But if you show partiality, you are committing sin and are convicted by the law as transgressors. 10 For whoever keeps the whole law but fails in one point has become guilty of all of it. 11 For he who said, ‚ÄúDo not commit adultery,‚Äù also said, ‚ÄúDo not murder.‚Äù If you do not commit adultery but do murder, you have become a transgressor of the law. 12 So speak and so act as those who are to be judged under the law of liberty. 13 For judgment is without mercy to one who has shown no mercy. Mercy triumphs over judgment.

Read: 2 John 7-13
Discussion Questions What insight, principle, or observation from this week‚Äôs sermon did you find to be the most helpful, eye-opening, or troubling? Explain. Last week you were supposed to do a personal Bible study and look up all the instances where the apostle John wrote that we are to love one another. Discuss what you found. John issued three commands in this text, the first is ‚Äúwatch yourselves‚Äù (v.8). How do you watch yourselves to prevent falling prey to false teachers? Why is going beyond the Word of God so dangerous? Name some of the ways this strategy has been used to lead people astray. What is significant about verse twelve? Discuss how we should apply what John said to those believers to our walk with Christ? Next Steps Next week we will begin to walk through the book of James. Please read the book of James every day this week (5 chapters will take about 15-20 minutes) and prepare for this exciting study.

Read: 2 John 4-6
Discussion Questions What insight, principle, or observation from this week‚Äôs sermon did you find to be the most helpful, eye-opening, or troubling? Explain. Last week you were supposed to read 2 John and write out what you observed from the text. Discuss what you saw in your study of this short letter. Have you ever learned a valuable lesson because you weren‚Äôt walking in truth? If you‚Äôre comfortable, share with your group what happened and what you learned. John said we are to love one another, what other ‚Äú___ one another‚Äù commands are given throughout scripture? Why do you think John often repeats the command of our Lord to love one another? Next Steps Do a personal Bible study this week and look up all the instances where the apostle John wrote that we are to love one another. Use a concordance or an online Bible study tool such as Logos free edition (https://www.logos.com/free-edition) to help you find what you need.

Read: 2 John 1-3
Discussion Questions What insight, principle, or observation from this week‚Äôs sermon did you find to be the most helpful, eye-opening, or troubling? Explain. John referred to himself as the elder, most likely referring to his status as an older man or mature believer and not to the office of elder. Name some reasons you think that is significant and what can we learn from that designation? Most of us have a bias toward being either loving or truthful. Which characterizes you? How do you become more balanced? Believers are to be united by truth, but we sometimes have different beliefs. How do we stay united within the church when we disagree? John said, ‚Äúthe truth will be with us forever.‚Äù Name some ways that statement encourages you or gives you hope. Next Steps Read 2 John every day this week and write down what you observe. Be prepared to discuss your observations in small group next week.

Jude 5-10 Now I want to remind you, although you once fully knew it, that Jesus, who saved a people out of the land of Egypt, afterward destroyed those who did not believe. 6 And the angels who did not stay within their own position of authority, but left their proper dwelling, he has kept in eternal chains under gloomy darkness until the judgment of the great day‚Äî 7 just as Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding cities, which likewise indulged in sexual immorality and pursued unnatural desire, serve as an example by undergoing a punishment of eternal fire. 8 Yet in like manner these people also, relying on their dreams, defile the flesh, reject authority, and blaspheme the glorious ones. 9 But when the archangel Michael, contending with the devil, was disputing about the body of Moses, he did not presume to pronounce a blasphemous judgment, but said, ‚ÄúThe Lord rebuke you.‚Äù 10 But these people blaspheme all that they do not understand, and they are destroyed by all that they, like unreasoning animals, understand instinctively.

Read Jude 1-4 (1) Jude, a servant of Jesus Christ and brother of James, To those who are called, beloved in God the Father and kept for Jesus Christ: (2) May mercy, peace, and love be multiplied to you. (3) Beloved, although I was very eager to write to you about our common salvation, I found it necessary to write appealing to you to contend for the faith that was once for all delivered to the saints. (4) For certain people have crept in unnoticed who long ago were designated for this condemnation, ungodly people, who pervert the grace of our God into sensuality and deny our only Master and Lord, Jesus Christ.

Discussion Questions Describe, in your own words, God‚Äôs sovereignty and discuss why this doctrine is viewed as either troubling or comforting. How should we view God‚Äôs sovereignty, especially when difficulties come? Describe a time when you followed a plan that was determined by your will rather than God‚Äôs Word. How did this turn out for you (and others)? How did Esther display courage in this text? Discuss what the Bible teaches about courage and how this virtue should impact your life. What are some of the dangers of living for your personal joy and happiness? How can you avoid these things? In what ways can we feed idolatry in our lives rather than forsaking it? Next Steps Think about the difficulties you‚Äôve experienced in your life and then consider how God has used those things to shape and sanctify you. Write down three lessons you‚Äôve learned through the difficulties you‚Äôve faced.
