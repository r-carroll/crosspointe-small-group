## Big Idea
God often allows difficulties to expose the orientation of your heart.

## Read: Esther 5:1-14
[Bible app link](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/EST.5.ESV)

## Discussion Questions
1. Describe, in your own words, God’s sovereignty and discuss why this doctrine is viewed as
either troubling or comforting. How should we view God’s sovereignty, especially when
difficulties come?
2. Describe a time when you followed a plan that was determined by your will rather than
God’s Word. How did this turn out for you (and others)?
3. How did Esther display courage in this text? Discuss what the Bible teaches about courage
and how this virtue should impact your life.
4. What are some of the dangers of living for your personal joy and happiness? How can you
avoid these things?
5. In what ways can we feed idolatry in our lives rather than forsaking it?

## Next Steps
Think about the difficulties you’ve experienced in your life and then consider how God has used
those things to shape and sanctify you. Write down three lessons you’ve learned through the
difficulties you’ve faced.

## Prayer Focus
Do you know someone who is going through a difficult situation? Pray that God will bring them
comfort and courage to face the circumstance and pray for God to grow them through the
challenge.
