# Week 3 - The Dearest Place on Earth

## Big Idea
We are given a charge in Matthew 28 that we refer to as the great commission. With this charge we often reflect on the evangelism aspect and sometimes forget the call given of baptizing believers, and following the commands, and teaching of Jesus. It is important to remember these teachings, and as a church to carry out the ordinances that Christ established for His bride.

## Text
Matthew 28:16-20

The 11 disciples traveled to Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had directed them. 17. When they saw Him, they worshiped, but some doubted. 18. Then Jesus came near and said to them, “All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth. 19. Go, therefore, and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, 20. teaching them to observe everything I have commanded you. And remember, I am with you always, to the end of the age.

## Discussion Questions
1. What is the importance of the local church following the commands of Christ?
2. In Acts 2:41 we see that 3,000 were added to the “Them” How were they added, and
what were they added to?
3. Why is it important to understand Baptism & the Lord’s Supper?
4. Is it ok to not partake in the Lord’s Supper?

## Next Steps
Over the week, prepare your heart to take the Lord’s Supper and spend time reflecting and evaluating your life using the following three questions: Do you have unconfessed sin? Are you living as if the remembrance of what Jesus has done doesn’t matter? Lastly, do you have strife or anger against a brother or sister in Christ that needs to be taken care of? The next step for some is obedience through following in believer’s baptism.

## Prayer Focus
Prepare your heart this week and pray that as a church our hearts are ready to take the Lord’s Supper Sunday.
