## Main Idea:
We must be active listeners to contend against apostasy

## Jude 11–16
Woe to them! For they walked in the way of Cain and abandoned themselves for the sake of
gain to Balaam’s error and perished in Korah’s rebellion. These are hidden reefs at your love
feasts, as they feast with you without fear, shepherds feeding themselves; waterless clouds,
swept along by winds; fruitless trees in late autumn, twice dead, uprooted; wild waves of the
sea, casting up the foam of their own shame; wandering stars, for whom the gloom of utter
darkness has been reserved forever.
It was also about these that Enoch, the seventh from Adam, prophesied, saying, “Behold, the
Lord comes with ten thousands of his holy ones, to execute judgment on all and to convict all
the ungodly of all their deeds of ungodliness that they have committed in such an ungodly way,
and of all the harsh things that ungodly sinners have spoken against him.” These are grumblers,
malcontents, following their own sinful desires; they are loud-mouthed boasters, showing
favoritism to gain advantage. (ESV)

## Discussion Questions
1. What stood out to you, made you think, or was something that you like, or remember
from the sermon?

2. What are some of the hidden reefs (hidden dangers) being preached in churches and
religions today? Why do you think people don’t see them?

3. What are some waterless clouds (empty promises) you have heard being preached and
taught?

4. What are some verses or passages in the Bible that talk about speech and the tongue?
5. Why is it important to stop listening to apostates?

## Next Steps: 
If you don’t regularly read your Bible make it a priority to start reading. If you do
read - take time to study the passage you are reading - perhaps read less to give yourself time
to answer questions about the passage and get a better understanding of everything you are
reading. We must know the Word to recognize false teaching and refute it.

## Prayer Focus: 
Ask God for wisdom and understanding as you read his Word. As you read
books or blogs from others or listen to podcasts pray that God would help you to have
discernment and to be able to identify error.
