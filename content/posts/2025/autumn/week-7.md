## Scripture
[Romans 11:33-36](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/ROM.11.ESV)

## Icebreaker Question
Describe a moment when you encountered something so vast or magnificent that it
left you speechless. What made it unforgettable?

1. As you consider Romans 9–11, why do you think Paul ends with worship
instead of further explanation? What does verse 33 show about how
doctrine should shape devotion?
2. How do Romans 9–10 help explain why Paul praises God’s wisdom in verses
33–34? What does this reveal about our limitations and God’s sovereignty?
3. How does verse 35 expose the prideful assumption that God “owes” us
something? How does this shape our understanding of salvation in Romans
11?
4. How does Paul’s statement in verse 36— “from Him and through Him and to
Him are all things”—summarize God’s purposes in Romans 9–11, and how
should it shape our own lives?

## Next Steps
Choose one section of Romans 9–11 this week
and journal how it leads you to worship the
God who is sovereign, merciful, and wise.

## Prayer Focus
Pray that God deepens our reverence for His
sovereignty, enlarges our gratitude for His
mercy, and fills our church with worship that
flows from truth.
