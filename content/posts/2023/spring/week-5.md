## Big Idea
Compromise with the world will always complicate the life of God’s people.

## Read: Esther 2:1-11
[Bible app link](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/EST.2.ESV)

## Discussion Questions
1. What was the most impactful thing from the text and the sermon this week?
2. Mordecai and Esther were caught by years of compromise and became like the Persians.
Discuss some of the ways are you most tempted to compromise with the world?
3. Verse six focuses our attention on the fact that the Jews were exiles in Persia. What are
some similarities believers share with exiles and in what ways is God’s grace given to
exiles?
4. Esther gained favor throughout this narrative (see, vs. 9,15,17). What can we assume
about Esther from the text? How does this apply to our lives in this world?
5. What character trait of Esther is revealed in verses 10 and 20? How does that trait impact
the story of Esther and what can we learn from her example?

## Next Steps
This week, read 1 Peter 2:1-10; Revelation 1:6; Colossians 1:13; and Ephesians 4:1 and consider
what it means that you are a citizen of two kingdoms and what that means for how you live
daily? What responsibilities and hope has God given you?

## Prayer Focus
As you pray this week, ask God to protect you from the temptation to compromise as you live
as a sojourner and exile (1 Pt. 2:11). Pray that you would “abstain from the passions of the
flesh” and “keep your conduct among Gentiles honorable” so that “they may see your good
deeds and glorify God.”
