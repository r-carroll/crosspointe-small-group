## Main Idea:
As children of God, it is necessary to be alert and ready to stand on truth and proclaim the truth
in the midst of opposition and persecution.

## Read
Jude 1-4
(1) Jude, a servant of Jesus Christ and brother of James, To those who are called, beloved in God the
Father and kept for Jesus Christ: (2) May mercy, peace, and love be multiplied to you. (3) Beloved,
although I was very eager to write to you about our common salvation, I found it necessary to write
appealing to you to contend for the faith that was once for all delivered to the saints. (4) For certain
people have crept in unnoticed who long ago were designated for this condemnation, ungodly people,
who pervert the grace of our God into sensuality and deny our only Master and Lord, Jesus Christ. (ESV)

## Discussion Questions
1. In verse 1, Jude identifies himself as a "servant of Jesus Christ and brother of James."
Why do you think Jude chose to introduce himself in this way, and what significance
does it hold for the message of his letter?

2. In verse 3, Jude urges believers to contend for the faith. What does it mean to contend
for the faith, and why is it important in our current cultural context?

3. Have you ever known anyone to leave the faith to follow a perverted gospel? If so, share
with the group what happened and any ramifications.
4. What are steps you can take to guard against being deceived? How would you know if
you are being deceived?
5. How do different religions view Jesus and why is it important to get it who Jesus is right?

## Next Steps: 
Take time this week and each week to read through the entire letter from Jude.
Read through it several times as we go through this study in the month of July.
## Prayer Focus: 
Ask God to help each of us to be discerning and aware of teachers and peers
we may be listening to, and even music, that could be leading us and others astray.
