## Question 3

>Listen to the talk that goes on in your home. How much of it is impatient and
unkind? How often are words spoken out of selfishness and personal
desire? How easily do outbursts of anger occur? How often do we bring up
past wrongs? How do we fail to communicate hope? How do we fail to
protect? How often do our words carry threats that we have “had it” and are
about to quit? Stop and listen, and you will see how much we need to hold
our talk to this standard of love, and how often the truth we profess to speak
has been distorted by our sin.

>There is yet another problem with the words of a fool: they are
presumptuous. In other words, fools make arrogant and boastful claims
about what they know and about what they will do, but they are unable to
back up their words with knowledge or action.
So the Preacher says, 
>>“A fool multiplies words, though no man knows what
is to be, and who can tell him what will be after him?” (Ecclesiastes 10:14).

>Fools are usually quite opinionated; they tend to be big talkers. For some
reason, a fool is seldom content to keep his folly to himself but insists on
sharing it with others. Words multiply. Fools go on and on, even when they
do not know what they are talking about. Plato once said, “Wise men speak
because they have something to say; fools because they have to say
something.”
One of the many things that foolish people like to talk about is the future. No
one knows what will happen in days to come, but for some reason this does
not stop the fool from predicting the future. Some fools have fanciful theories
about global disasters. Others have big plans for the future. To hear them
talk about it, they are always one lucky break from striking it rich or landing
their dream job. They boast about a “done deal” before the deal is actually
done. This is all very foolish, because if there is one thing we can never
presume, it is to know the future.
