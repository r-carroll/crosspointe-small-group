## Big Idea
Jesus invites people to have life.

## Read: John 7:37-39
37 On the last day of the feast, the great day, Jesus stood up and cried out, “If anyone thirsts, let him come to me and drink. 38 Whoever believes in me, as[a] the Scripture has said, ‘Out of his heart will flow rivers of living water.’” 39 Now this he said about the Spirit, whom those who believed in him were to receive, for as yet the Spirit had not been given, because Jesus was not yet glorified.

## Discussion Questions
1. What was the most impactful thing from the text and the sermon this week?
2. The truth Jesus reveals in verse 37 is that everyone thirsts. What causes people
to become dry and unfulfilled? Does this condition affect believers? If so, explain
how and why.
3. Discuss the life-altering significance of the Spirit being in every believer as a “river
of living water.”
> Read: John 14:26, 14:16, Romans 8:26, Titus 3:4-7
4. What does this passage have to do with evangelism?
5. Name two or three things you have you learned from this series and share how you
believe those lessons will affect your walk with Christ in 2023.

## Next Steps
This week, think about the people in your life who need to hear the invitation that Jesus
gave, write down the name(s), and look for opportunities for them to believe Jesus and receive
the Living Water they need.

> Extra next steps: Think about the people in your life that may be struggling with depression. Spend time this week praying for them, and look for opportunities to reach out to them, encourage them, and share the Living Water with them.

## Prayer Focus
Pray specifically that God would bring lost people to CrossPointe so they can be
introduced to the Living Water and be saved. We want people to come to Jesus
through CrossPointe Church!
