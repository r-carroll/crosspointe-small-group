## March Prayer Meeting

### Blest Be the Tie That Binds
Blest be the tie that binds \
our hearts in Christian love; \
the fellowship of kindred minds \
is like to that above.

Before our Father's throne \
we pour our ardent prayers; \
our fears, our hopes, our aims are one, \
our comforts and our cares. 

We share our mutual woes, \
our mutual burdens bear, \
and often for each other flows \
the sympathizing tear.
