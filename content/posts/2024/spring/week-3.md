## Big Idea
Genuine care leads to action.

## Read
[Romans 1:8-15](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/ROM.1.ESV)

## Discussion Questions
1. What stood out to you?
2. In verse 8, Paul expresses gratitude for the faith of the Roman Christians. How does expressing gratitude for the faith of others contribute to building a strong Christian community?
3. In verse 10, Paul mentions his desire to visit the Roman Christians. What do you think motivated Paul's desire to do so? How does face-to-face interaction impact our relationships with fellow believers and our ability to support and encourage one another?
4. Verse 11 speaks of Paul's longing to impart some spiritual gift to the Romans to strengthen them. What do you think Paul means by "spiritual gift" in this context? How do spiritual gifts contribute to the growth and edification of the church today?
5. Paul expresses his eagerness to preach the gospel in Rome in verse 15. What do you think made Paul so eager to preach the gospel, even to those who were already believers? How can we cultivate a similar eagerness to share the gospel with others?
6. In verses 13-14, Paul states that he has often intended to visit Rome but has been prevented. Have you ever experienced obstacles or hindrances in serving God or fulfilling His purposes? How did you respond to these challenges, and what did you learn from them?

## Next Steps
We care about many different things, and it’s very easy to become drawn away by the things that matter to us. As you spend time with the Lord this week, think about how your life reflects genuine care for others as it relates to the gospel.

## Prayer Focus
