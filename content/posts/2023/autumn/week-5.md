## Discussion Questions
1. What insight, principle, or observation from this week’s sermon was the most helpful, eyeopening, or troubling? Explain.
2. James issued eleven commands in this section. Which of these commands do you struggle
with the most?
3. Read verse seven. How do the actions of submitting to God and resisting the devil relate
to one another, and what are some ways you can resist the devil?
4. Read verse nine. Why is genuine repentance essential in our relationship with God? How can
we cultivate a repentant heart?
5. In verse twelve, James warns against judging others. What do you think he means by this?
How can we be discerning but not go over the line in our attitude and interactions with
others?

## Next Steps
How does God’s grace impact your life every day? Meditate on verses 7-10 this week and
evaluate how you respond to the grace you’ve received. And be sure to vote on Tuesday!

## Prayer Focus
Issue 1 in Ohio has the potential to erase every pro-life law in our state. As God’s people, we are
to love what God loves and hate what God hates. God creates life, and He condemns the act of
taking innocent human life. Please pray earnestly that God would turn the hearts of voters to
reject Issue 1.
