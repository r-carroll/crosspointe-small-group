## Icebreaker 
If you could witness one scene from the Old Testament,
what would it be? Why?

1. When Abraham walks toward Mount Moriah, he trusts God would not break
His promises about Isaac. What promises do we have from God?
2. God had given Abraham sufficient reason to trust Him. For example, he
worked a miracle to bring Isaac into existence. What reasons has God given
us to trust Him?
3. Read Gen 22:12. Abraham did not withhold his only son from God. What
things or people are we tempted to withhold from God?

## Next Steps
Repent of any Lack of trust in God.
Ask God to identify idols in your life and to enable
you to remove them.
Meditate in the promises God has given to all
believers.

## Prayer Focus
That God would forgive you for any lack of trust in
Him.
That God would identify idols in your life and
enable you to remove them.
